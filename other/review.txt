Code Review and Suggestions for Improvement

1. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement more robust error handling throughout the codebase.
   - Use a logging library (e.g., Python's built-in logging module) instead of print statements for better debugging and monitoring.

2. Configuration Management:
   - Consider using a configuration management library like python-decouple or dynaconf for managing environment variables and configuration settings.

3. Type Hinting:
   - Add type hints to function parameters and return values for better code readability and maintainability.

4. Code Duplication:
   - Refactor repeated code patterns, especially in the model_interface.py file, to reduce duplication.

5. Testing:
   - Implement unit tests for critical functions to ensure code reliability and ease of maintenance.

6. Documentation:
   - Add more inline comments to explain complex logic.
   - Create docstrings for all classes and methods following a consistent format (e.g., Google style).

7. Dependency Management:
   - Use a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file to manage project dependencies.

8. Code Structure:
   - Consider breaking down larger functions (e.g., in optimize.py) into smaller, more focused functions for better readability and maintainability.

9. Asynchronous Processing:
   - Implement asynchronous processing for API calls to improve performance, especially when dealing with multiple model providers.

10. Security:
    - Implement proper security measures for handling API keys and sensitive information.

11. User Interface:
    - Consider creating a simple CLI or web interface for easier interaction with the tool.

12. Metrics Visualization:
    - Enhance the dashboard generation with interactive charts using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh.

13. Caching Strategy:
    - Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy, possibly using a database for larger datasets.

14. Code Formatting:
    - Use a code formatter like Black to ensure consistent code style across the project.

15. Performance Optimization:
    - Profile the code to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, especially in the evaluation and prompt generation processes.

These suggestions aim to improve the overall quality, maintainability, and performance of the codebase.
