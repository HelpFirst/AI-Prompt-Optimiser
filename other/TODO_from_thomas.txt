TODO:
- Set package versions in requirements
- Specify python version used / supported

- Remove .DS_Store

- Some unused imports (e.g. optimize.py)
- Make any private functions private
- there are some really long functions that I would tend to avoid (normally makes it harder to read and suggests they are doing multiple things)>
- Then Iâ€™d just reiterate what I mentioned about tests, personally I think its important and would have for anything I published
- I also think some of it would really benefit from being class based, things like what provider to use could really benefit from factory and provider adaptors, but thats a much bigger change

DONE:
- Remove things in other - all?
- Remove readme.md from src
- Move examples.py from root?
