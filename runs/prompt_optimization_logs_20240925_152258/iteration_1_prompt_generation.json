  "initial_prompt": "Please look for the following risk factor: Is the client at risk of self-harm? For instance, do they mention suicidal thoughts or ideation? Do they imply they might do physical damage to themselves or to property? Do they reference wanting to 'end it all or say it's 'not worth living'? Please output: 1. risk_type: // suicidality, 2. risk_output: // 'risk present' : this means there is evidence this risk is present in the case 'risk not present' : there is evidence the risk is NOT present or there is no evidence whether the case contains that risk or not. (If in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and say 'risk present') 3. explanation: // State words/terms that indicate the reason the risk_output was chosen. Be brief in your explanation. State facts found in the text, do not infer. E.g. 'Client expressed suicidal ideation'. Leave blank for 'risk not present.'",
  "analysis": "**Analysis**\n\nThe model incorrectly classified a total of 5 texts: 3 as positive (when they were actually negative) and 2 as negative (when they were actually positive).\n\n**False Positives (Incorrectly Classified as Positive)**\n\n1. **Example**: \"I loved 'Tiny Toons'... A few years later, my friend had the video. And I figured I'd watch it for the good old days. I was still on the floors laughing.\" (Actual classification: Negative)\n\t* This text appears to be an enthusiastic endorsement of a cartoon, but upon closer inspection, the tone is actually nostalgic and humorous, with the author expressing a desire to relive their childhood memories.\n\t* The model likely misclassified this text due to the presence of positive sentiment words (\"loved,\" \"laughing\") and the lack of explicit negative language.\n2. **Example**: \"I personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all... I loved every second of this movie.\" (Actual classification: Negative)\n\t* This text is actually an argument in favor of the film's ending, despite some critics' opinions that it was too action-oriented.\n\t* The model may have misclassified this text due to the presence of words like \"loved\" and \"every second,\" which convey a positive sentiment, without fully understanding the context and nuance of the author's opinion.\n3. **Example**: \"I've seen this movie 3 times & I've liked it every time.\" (Actual classification: Negative)\n\t* This text is actually an endorsement of a TV movie about serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, despite its dark subject matter.\n\t* The model likely misclassified this text due to the presence of positive sentiment words (\"liked,\" \"every time\") and the lack of explicit negative language.\n\n**False Negatives (Incorrectly Classified as Negative)**\n\n1. **Example**: \"This is one of the funniest cartoons I have ever seen.\" (Actual classification: Positive)\n\t* This text is a clear endorsement of a cartoon, using positive sentiment words like \"funniest\" and \"ever.\"\n\t* The model likely misclassified this text due to the lack of explicit negative language or critical tone.\n2. **Example**: \"I have rated this film at the highest possible rating.\" (Actual classification: Positive)\n\t* This text is a clear endorsement of a short film, using positive sentiment words like \"highest\" and \"excellent quality.\"\n\t* The model likely misclassified this text due to the lack of explicit negative language or critical tone.\n\n**Insights**\n\nThe errors in classification suggest that the prompt may be too sensitive to positive sentiment words, without fully considering the context and nuance of the text. Additionally, the prompt may not be adequately trained on texts with complex opinions or nuanced sentiments.\n\n**Strategies for Improvement**\n\n1. **Add more training data**: Include a diverse set of texts with complex opinions and nuanced sentiments to improve the model's understanding of subtle differences in classification.\n2. **Implement sentiment analysis techniques**: Use techniques like sentiment intensity, emotional tone, and context-aware sentiment analysis to better understand the nuances of text sentiment.\n3. **Incorporate more features**: Incorporate additional features, such as topic modeling, entity recognition, or aspect-based sentiment analysis, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of text content.\n4. **Adjust the prompt's sensitivity**: Adjust the prompt's sensitivity to balance false positives and false negatives by considering both explicit and implicit negative language.\n5. **Use ensemble methods**: Combine multiple models with different architectures or training data to improve overall performance and reduce errors.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the classification prompt can better recognize nuances in text sentiment, reducing both false positives and false negatives and improving overall accuracy.",
  "new_prompt": "Here's a refined version of the prompt:\n\n\"I'm looking for evidence of self-harm risk in this text. Consider both explicit and implicit language, as well as the tone and context. I want you to indicate whether there is a risk present or not, with 'risk present' meaning you've found evidence of a potential threat to the client's safety or well-being. Provide 'suicidality' as the relevant risk type. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and choose 'risk present.' Please also provide an explanation for your classification, stating only facts from the text without inference.\""
