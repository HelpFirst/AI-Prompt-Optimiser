  "initial_prompt": "Here's a refined version of the prompt:\n\n\"I'm looking for evidence of self-harm risk in this text. Consider both explicit and implicit language, as well as the tone and context. I want you to indicate whether there is a risk present or not, with 'risk present' meaning you've found evidence of a potential threat to the client's safety or well-being. Provide 'suicidality' as the relevant risk type. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and choose 'risk present.' Please also provide an explanation for your classification, stating only facts from the text without inference.\"",
  "analysis": "After analyzing the misclassified texts, I've identified specific examples from each set where the model made a mistake and highlighted what elements of the text may have led to the incorrect classification.\n\n**Negative (0) texts incorrectly classified as positive:**\n\n1. **Text:** \"I'm so excited for my upcoming vacation in Hawaii! The beaches are stunning, and I've heard great things about the luaus.\"\n\t* **Incorrect classification:** Positive\n\t* **Correct classification:** Should be Negative, as this text is not expressing any negative sentiment or tone.\n\t* **Insight:** This misclassification might be due to the presence of positive words like \"excited\" and \"stunning,\" which overrode the model's ability to detect a lack of negativity.\n2. **Text:** \"I've been trying to get into shape for my wedding, but it's been tough. I'm struggling with motivation.\"\n\t* **Incorrect classification:** Positive\n\t* **Correct classification:** Should be Negative, as this text expresses frustration and disappointment.\n\t* **Insight:** This misclassification might be due to the model's tendency to focus on words like \"wedding\" and \"motivation,\" which have a positive connotation, rather than detecting the underlying negative emotions.\n\n**Positive (1) texts incorrectly classified as negative:**\n\n1. **Text:** \"I just tried out my new cooking class and I'm absolutely loving it! The instructors are so helpful.\"\n\t* **Incorrect classification:** Negative\n\t* **Correct classification:** Should be Positive, as this text expresses enthusiasm and satisfaction.\n\t* **Insight:** This misclassification might be due to the model's sensitivity to words like \"struggling\" or \"difficulty,\" which can sometimes appear in positive texts (e.g., \"I'm struggling to choose between two amazing options\"). In this case, the presence of \"absolutely loving it\" and \"helpful\" likely overrode any negative connotations.\n2. **Text:** \"I recently went on a meditation retreat and had an incredible experience. I feel more centered than ever.\"\n\t* **Incorrect classification:** Negative\n\t* **Correct classification:** Should be Positive, as this text expresses joy and well-being.\n\t* **Insight:** This misclassification might be due to the model's tendency to focus on words like \"retreat,\" which can sometimes imply isolation or negative experiences. However, in this case, the presence of positive words like \"incredible\" and \"centered\" likely overrode any potential negativity.\n\n**Strategies to improve the classification prompt:**\n\n1. **Emphasize nuance:** Incorporate more subtle language around sentiment, such as phrases that hint at underlying emotions (e.g., \"I'm struggling,\" but also \"I'm excited\") or words that convey tone and attitude (e.g., \"absolutely loving it\").\n2. **Contextualize the text:** Consider adding context to the prompt, which can help disambiguate positive and negative sentiment. For example, if a user mentions \"struggling\" in the context of a cooking class, this could indicate enthusiasm rather than frustration.\n3. **Focus on tone markers:** Train the model to recognize words or phrases that convey strong emotions (positive or negative). Tone markers like \"absolutely,\" \"extremely,\" or \"I'm so grateful for\" can help differentiate between positive and negative sentiment.\n4. **Use more robust sentiment analysis:** Consider incorporating additional sentiment analysis techniques, such as aspect-based sentiment analysis, which can detect specific aspects of a text that convey sentiment (e.g., the instructor's helpfulness in the cooking class example).\n5. **Regularly retrain and fine-tune the model:** Continuously update the model with new data and refine its performance using active learning methods, where human evaluators provide feedback on the most uncertain examples.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can improve the classification prompt to better recognize the nuances that led to errors in sentiment analysis. This will help reduce both false positives (incorrectly classified as positive) and false negatives (incorrectly classified as negative), leading to more accurate predictions for your users.",
  "new_prompt": "Here's a revised and refined prompt:\n\n\"I'm seeking evidence of self-harm risk in this text, considering both explicit and implicit language, tone, and context. Indicate 'risk present' if you've found potential threats to the client's safety or well-being, with suicidality as the relevant risk type. When in doubt, prioritize caution and choose 'risk present.' Identify subtle cues like emotional expressions (e.g., 'struggling' vs. 'excited'), tone markers (e.g., 'absolutely loving it'), and contextual hints that might indicate positive or negative sentiment.\"\n\nThis revised prompt aims to incorporate the strategies discussed earlier, emphasizing nuance, contextualization, tone markers, and robust sentiment analysis. By doing so, it should improve the model's accuracy in detecting self-harm risk while reducing false positives and negatives.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any further refinements!"
