    "false_negatives": "### Analysis of False Negatives\n\n1. **Overemphasis on Negative Context**: Both texts contain strong negative descriptors and comparisons that overshadow the positive elements. The analysis focused too heavily on the negative aspects, leading to a misclassification. To improve recall, the classifier should balance the weight given to positive descriptors against negative ones, especially when positive sentiments are present.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Sarcasm**: The second text is heavily sarcastic, which can mislead sentiment analysis. The classifier should incorporate a mechanism to detect sarcasm more effectively, recognizing that sarcastic remarks can sometimes mask underlying positive sentiments or humor.\n\n3. **Contextual Nuance**: The first text mentions positive portrayals of actors and the film's status as a classic, which were not sufficiently weighted in the analysis. The classifier should enhance its ability to recognize and weigh contextual nuances, especially when positive phrases are used in a mixed sentiment context.\n\n4. **Explicit Positive Elements**: In both examples, there are explicit mentions of positive aspects (e.g., \"brilliant portrayals,\" \"entertains through some suspense\"). The classifier should ensure that these explicit positive elements are not overlooked, even when they are surrounded by negative commentary.\n\n5. **Improved Sentiment Scoring**: Implement a scoring system that allows for a more nuanced classification, where texts can receive partial scores for positive and negative sentiments. This would help in cases where mixed sentiments are present, allowing for a more accurate overall classification.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- **Balance Positive and Negative Weights**: Adjust the algorithm to ensure that positive descriptors are given appropriate weight, even in the presence of negative commentary.\n- **Sarcasm Detection**: Integrate a sarcasm detection mechanism to better interpret the tone of the text.\n- **Contextual Analysis**: Enhance the model's ability to analyze context and recognize when positive phrases are present, regardless of surrounding negativity.\n- **Explicit Positive Recognition**: Ensure that explicit positive statements are highlighted and factored into the overall sentiment score.\n- **Nuanced Scoring System**: Develop a scoring system that allows for partial classifications, accommodating mixed sentiments more effectively.",
    "true_positives": "1. **Strong Positive Descriptors**: Each true positive example prominently features strong positive descriptors such as \"masterful,\" \"terrific,\" \"excellent quality,\" and \"funniest cartoons.\" These descriptors create a clear and compelling positive sentiment that is easy to identify. Reinforcing the use of such strong adjectives in the classification process can enhance accuracy.\n\n2. **Emotional Engagement**: The texts consistently express emotional engagement, whether through nostalgia, enjoyment, or admiration for performances. Phrases like \"leaves the viewer wanting more\" and \"I loved every second\" indicate a deep connection with the content. Emphasizing the importance of emotional language in sentiment analysis can help classifiers recognize positive sentiment more effectively.\n\n3. **Explicit Ratings**: Many true positives include explicit ratings (e.g., \"9/10,\" \"10/10,\" \"two thumbs way up\"), which serve as clear indicators of positive sentiment. Incorporating a focus on explicit ratings in the classification criteria can provide a straightforward metric for determining sentiment.\n\n4. **Contextual Comparisons**: Several examples utilize comparisons to highlight superiority (e.g., \"much better,\" \"far exceeded my expectations\"). This contextual framing helps to establish a positive sentiment relative to other works. Encouraging classifiers to pay attention to comparative language can improve their ability to discern positive sentiment.\n\n5. **Absence of Mixed Sentiments**: The true positives are characterized by a lack of mixed sentiments or sarcasm, allowing for a clear positive classification. Training classifiers to identify and flag potential mixed sentiments or sarcasm can help reduce false negatives and improve overall classification accuracy. \n\nBy focusing on these key elements, sentiment analysis classifiers can enhance their ability to accurately identify positive sentiments in various texts.",

Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for \"Fast Times,\" then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text begins by noting that 'Valley Girl' launched Nicolas Cage's career, which suggests a positive impact on his career, but it does not explicitly express strong positive sentiment. The phrase 'an 80's version of Romeo and Juliet' implies a comparison that could be interpreted positively, but it is not a definitive positive statement. The assertion that it is 'a definite example of an 80's teen classic' serves as a positive descriptor, highlighting the film's significance. However, the sentiment turns slightly mixed when the text states that it will 'never top' 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' indicating a negative comparison. The phrase about the 80's generation of teen flicks being 'just a big blow to the head' is clearly negative and diminishes the overall positive sentiment. Despite the positive portrayals mentioned, the text ultimately leans toward a mixed sentiment due to the strong negative opinions expressed about the genre and the comparison with 'Fast Times.' Therefore, while there are positive elements, the overall sentiment is overshadowed by negative descriptors and comparisons, leading to a classification of negative sentiment.\n\n\n** Text 2:\nWas this based on a comic-book? A video-game? A drawing by a 3 year-old?  There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. Nothing. We have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, Stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb (\"tango-tango\"). A film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Oh, yes: and the unintentional humour. The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a \"swell\" time. Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. And then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.  Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clich\u00c3\u00a9d, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. After the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT??? Very silly. Apparently they don't trust Stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage. Nevertheless, our gangsters make Stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. Everyone convinced? Good. You'd better be. Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone. The old guy who flies the chopper... How the hell did he fall for the trap? Firstly, he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard Stallone's and Rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. \"Get off my back!\" Lithgow: \"I haven't even started climbing on your back.\" Or, Lithgow to Stallone: \"We had a deal, but now we only have each other!\" And as for Lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. They are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on.  Stallone co-wrote this thing. I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses predominantly negative sentiments about the movie in question. It starts with rhetorical questions that undermine the seriousness of the film, suggesting a lack of credibility ('There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all'). This is followed by a series of strong negative descriptors regarding the characters, dialogue, and plot, indicating frustration and disappointment. Phrases such as 'dialog so dumb', 'bad and unconvincing gay banter', and 'awful dialog-writing' convey a clear disdain for the quality of writing and performances. Even when the reviewer attempts to highlight some entertaining aspects, like 'some suspense' and 'good action-sequences', these are quickly overshadowed by the overwhelming critique of the film's absurdity and lack of logic. Furthermore, the mention of 'unintentional humour' and 'mindless fun' does not contribute to a positive sentiment but rather points out how the film fails to achieve its intended goals. The tone is heavily sarcastic and critical throughout, with phrases like 'silly', 'very creative about it', and questioning Stallone's mental state while writing the script serving to emphasize the overall negative assessment. Despite mentioning some entertaining action scenes, the context in which they are presented is filled with sarcasm and critique. Thus, the overall sentiment is decidedly negative, lacking strong positive descriptors or a genuine appreciation for the film.\n\n\nContext:\n- Total number of predictions: 20\n- Number of false negatives: 2\n- Percentage of false negatives: 10.00%\n- False negative to false positive ratio: inf\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\n\nProvide a concise analysis of these false negatives, focusing only on high-confidence observations.

The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps \"A Cry in the Dark\" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text begins by describing 'A Cry in the Dark' as a 'masterful piece of cinema,' which is a strong positive descriptor indicating high quality. The terms 'haunting' and 'incredibly thought provoking' further reinforce the positive sentiment by emphasizing the emotional impact of the film. The mention of the true story adds a layer of depth, as it connects the viewer to real-life events, which can amplify emotional engagement. The phrase 'brutally taken' introduces a slight negative tone but is necessary for context, and it doesn\u2019t detract from the overall positive sentiment about the film. Meryl Streep's performance is described as doing 'immaculate justice' to the role, showcasing strong positive feelings towards her acting. Furthermore, 'brilliant direction' indicates high praise for the film's execution.

Overall, the text is heavily weighted with positive descriptors and emotional engagement, leading to a clear positive sentiment despite the dark subject matter. There are no mixed sentiments or sarcasm present in the text.\n\n\n** Text 2:\nI was watching the Perfect Storm, and thought about another Wolfgang Peterson film which is much better--this one. Although certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. It has a terrific story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret Service and Russo is easy on the eyes. If you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment towards the movie 'In the Line of Fire'.

The mention of Malkovich winning a 'well-deserved Oscar' adds credibility to the praise, suggesting that the performance is highly regarded. The adjectives 'creepy' and 'tortured' describe the characters in a compelling manner, enhancing the emotional engagement. The phrase 'easy on the eyes' when referring to Russo adds a light, positive touch. The recommendation to 'definitely rent it or buy it' shows a strong endorsement, and the concluding statement that it is 'one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade' solidifies the positive sentiment. The explicit rating of '9/10' reinforces the positive classification, as it indicates a strong appreciation for the film. Overall, there are no negative descriptors or mixed sentiments that would detract from the positive classification.\n\n\n** Text 3:\nThe idea ia a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that I have seen. I have rated this film at the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment. What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward. I hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea'. I look forward to viewing the sequence. Once again congrats to Halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment toward a short film.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience.

The movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. I give it two thumbs way up!\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text begins with a positive sentiment, stating 'The best thing from the American Pie 'bakery,' which establishes a favorable opinion right away.

Overall, the overwhelming sentiment from the text is positive due to the expressions of enjoyment, surprise, and favorable evaluations of the stories and characters.\n\n\n** Text 6:\nI do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it. They did the best that they could do and I think that this should be taken more as A Final FMV.. the last fight.  Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely amazing  Story 8.5/10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more. And the stuff they could put in there was clever enough I thought.  Characters 9/10 - Well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins.  Sound - 10/10, since i am a metal fan I loved the fight music.. and piano just reaches right in there..It is a great ST and I was not disappointed. Tilt/Replay 10/10 - Enjoyable every time.  Overall- 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) I personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all.. the plot was already in place. The action was necessary as much as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time.

I've seen this movie 3 times & I've liked it every time. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is. An HBO TV movie- very well done like most of their movies are- this would've gotten Oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for TV. As I'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial murderer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried & couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in America, investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration. According to this acct, Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner. Rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't overact, chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. He is a man with passion, but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies. He only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. He just *is* - His character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year. Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. He makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility. A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such \"monsters.\" The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (impossible though it may seem) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done. Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov. But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for. Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay. The screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people *behind* the facts. 9 out of 10 stars\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment towards the movie being reviewed. The reviewer states they've seen the movie three times and liked it every time, which indicates a high level of enjoyment and appreciation. Phrases like 'very well done', 'would've gotten Oscars', and 'fine performances' serve as strong positive descriptors, emphasizing the quality of the film and its execution. The reviewer also highlights specific performances, such as Stephen Rea's portrayal of Victor Burakov, describing it as 'played to perfection' and stating that he 'makes us feel for this man'. This emotional engagement is significant and adds to the overall positive sentiment. Additionally, the mention of a 'very touching scene' suggests that the film evokes strong emotions, which further supports the positive classification. The reviewer also rates the film 9 out of 10 stars, an explicit rating that indicates a strong positive opinion. While the subject matter of the film is dark and involves a serial murderer, the review focuses on the film's strengths, such as its direction, screenplay, and character development, rather than the negative aspects of its content. Overall, there are no signs of mixed sentiments or sarcasm; the language used is consistently positive throughout. Therefore, the classification is 1 for positive sentiment.\n\n\nContext:\n- Total number of predictions: 20\n- Number of true positives: 8\n- Percentage of true positives: 40.00%\n- True positive to false positive ratio: inf\n- True positive to false negative ratio: 4.00\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\n\nProvide a concise analysis of these true positives, focusing only on high-confidence observations.

After your analysis, respond with a strict JSON dictionary containing two keys: \"chain_of_thought\" (your detailed step-by-step reasoning) and \"classification\" (1 for positive, 0 for negative). \n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here\",\n    \"classification\": 0 or 1\n}\nEnsure that \"chain_of_thought\" contains your comprehensive analysis, and \"classification\" is strictly 0 or 1.\n\n## Metrics (performance of the current prompt):\n- Precision: 1.0\n- Recall: 0.8\n- Accuracy: 0.9\n- F1 Score: 0.8888888888888888\n- Total Predictions: 20\n- Valid Predictions: 20\n- Invalid Predictions (wrong output formatting): 0\n\n---- ANALYSIS ----\n\n## True Positives Analysis: (to include suggestion in the new prompt to reinforce these patters)\n1. **Strong Positive Descriptors**: Each true positive example prominently features strong positive descriptors such as \"masterful,\" \"terrific,\" \"excellent quality,\" and \"funniest cartoons.\" These descriptors create a clear and compelling positive sentiment that is easy to identify. Reinforcing the use of such strong adjectives in the classification process can enhance accuracy.\n\n2. **Emotional Engagement**: The texts consistently express emotional engagement, whether through nostalgia, enjoyment, or admiration for performances. Phrases like \"leaves the viewer wanting more\" and \"I loved every second\" indicate a deep connection with the content. Emphasizing the importance of emotional language in sentiment analysis can help classifiers recognize positive sentiment more effectively.\n\n3. **Explicit Ratings**: Many true positives include explicit ratings (e.g., \"9/10,\" \"10/10,\" \"two thumbs way up\"), which serve as clear indicators of positive sentiment. Incorporating a focus on explicit ratings in the classification criteria can provide a straightforward metric for determining sentiment.\n\n4. **Contextual Comparisons**: Several examples utilize comparisons to highlight superiority (e.g., \"much better,\" \"far exceeded my expectations\"). This contextual framing helps to establish a positive sentiment relative to other works. Encouraging classifiers to pay attention to comparative language can improve their ability to discern positive sentiment.\n\n5. **Absence of Mixed Sentiments**: The true positives are characterized by a lack of mixed sentiments or sarcasm, allowing for a clear positive classification. Training classifiers to identify and flag potential mixed sentiments or sarcasm can help reduce false negatives and improve overall classification accuracy. \n\nBy focusing on these key elements, sentiment analysis classifiers can enhance their ability to accurately identify positive sentiments in various texts.\n\n## False Positives Analysis (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these errors):\nNo false positives found in this iteration.\n\n## False Negatives Analysis (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these errors)::\n### Analysis of False Negatives\n\n1. **Overemphasis on Negative Context**: Both texts contain strong negative descriptors and comparisons that overshadow the positive elements. The analysis focused too heavily on the negative aspects, leading to a misclassification. To improve recall, the classifier should balance the weight given to positive descriptors against negative ones, especially when positive sentiments are present.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Sarcasm**: The second text is heavily sarcastic, which can mislead sentiment analysis. The classifier should incorporate a mechanism to detect sarcasm more effectively, recognizing that sarcastic remarks can sometimes mask underlying positive sentiments or humor.\n\n3. **Contextual Nuance**: The first text mentions positive portrayals of actors and the film's status as a classic, which were not sufficiently weighted in the analysis. The classifier should enhance its ability to recognize and weigh contextual nuances, especially when positive phrases are used in a mixed sentiment context.\n\n4. **Explicit Positive Elements**: In both examples, there are explicit mentions of positive aspects (e.g., \"brilliant portrayals,\" \"entertains through some suspense\"). The classifier should ensure that these explicit positive elements are not overlooked, even when they are surrounded by negative commentary.\n\n5. **Improved Sentiment Scoring**: Implement a scoring system that allows for a more nuanced classification, where texts can receive partial scores for positive and negative sentiments. This would help in cases where mixed sentiments are present, allowing for a more accurate overall classification.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n- **Balance Positive and Negative Weights**: Adjust the algorithm to ensure that positive descriptors are given appropriate weight, even in the presence of negative commentary.\n- **Sarcasm Detection**: Integrate a sarcasm detection mechanism to better interpret the tone of the text.\n- **Contextual Analysis**: Enhance the model's ability to analyze context and recognize when positive phrases are present, regardless of surrounding negativity.\n- **Explicit Positive Recognition**: Ensure that explicit positive statements are highlighted and factored into the overall sentiment score.\n- **Nuanced Scoring System**: Develop a scoring system that allows for partial classifications, accommodating mixed sentiments more effectively.\n\n## Invalid Outputs Analysis (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these output formatting errors):\nNo invalid outputs found in this iteration.\n\n---- OUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS ----\n\n## Output Format Instructions (to ensure that the improved prompt will generate outputs in the correct format):\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here\"\n    \"classification\": 0 or 1,\n}\nEnsure that \"chain_of_thought\" contains your detailed analysis, and \"classification\" is strictly 0 or 1\n\n\n---- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ----\n\n\n---- IMPROVED PROMPT ----\n\n## GOAL: Create a concise, improved prompt that addresses the most critical issues identified in the analyses. Focus on:\n1. Increasing precision and recall of the classification task\n2. Maintaining or improving overall accuracy and F1 score\n3. Reducing invalid outputs\n4. Adhering to the output format instructions\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Keep the prompt short and focused.\n2. Prioritize clarity and effectiveness over length.\n3. Provide only the new, improved prompt in plain text without any additional explanations or headers.\n4. Include the chain of thought in the prompt to guide the model to think step by step with custom instructions.\n\n## GENERARAL TACTICS FOR PROMPT WRITTING:\n1.
