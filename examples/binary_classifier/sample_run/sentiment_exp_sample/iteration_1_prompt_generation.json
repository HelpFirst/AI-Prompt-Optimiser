  "analysis_results": {
    "false_positives": "1. **Mixed Sentiment Interpretation**: Both texts exhibit a blend of positive and negative sentiments, leading to confusion in classification. The analysis should prioritize identifying the dominant sentiment rather than treating positive and negative elements as equally weighted. Improvement: Implement a scoring system that quantifies positive and negative phrases to determine the overall sentiment more accurately.\n\n2. **Contextual Nuance**: The authors use irony and sarcasm, particularly in Text 2, which can mislead sentiment analysis. The phrase \"great trash\" suggests enjoyment of low-quality films, but the overall description remains negative. Improvement: Enhance the model's ability to detect sarcasm and contextual humor, possibly through training on datasets that include such nuances.\n\n3. **Recommendation Weighting**: In both examples, the presence of a recommendation or a positive conclusion sways the classification towards positive sentiment, despite significant negative commentary. Improvement: Establish clearer guidelines for weighing recommendations against critical assessments, ensuring that the overall sentiment reflects the majority of the text rather than isolated positive statements.\n\n4. **Clarity in Language**: The use of phrases like \"really awful, but then again\" in Text 2 creates ambiguity. The analysis should clarify how such phrases impact sentiment. Improvement: Develop a more robust framework for parsing complex sentence structures that may indicate mixed sentiments, ensuring that the classifier can accurately interpret the intent behind such phrases.\n\n5. **Focus on Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the text should be a key factor in classification. In both examples, the initial negative tone is overshadowed by later positive remarks. Improvement: Train the model to assess the overall tone throughout the text, rather than allowing later positive comments to dominate the sentiment classification.",
    "false_negatives": "1. **Overemphasis on Humor**: The chain of thought notes \"unintentional humour\" and describes some aspects as \"almost hilarious,\" which could be misinterpreted as positive sentiment. The classifier should better differentiate between humor derived from poor execution (negative) and humor that is genuinely enjoyable (positive). \n\n2. **Ambiguous Language**: Phrases like \"mindless fun at its best\" and \"silly\" can be interpreted in multiple ways. The classifier should be trained to recognize context more effectively, especially when the language is ambiguous, to avoid misclassifying negative sentiments as positive.\n\n3. **Negation Handling**: The text contains several negative phrases that are negated by the surrounding context, such as \"nothing in this movie to be taken seriously.\" The classifier should improve its ability to identify and process negations to ensure that negative sentiments are not overlooked.\n\n4. **Focus on Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the review is negative, despite some mixed sentiments about specific scenes. The classifier should prioritize the overall sentiment expressed in the text rather than getting caught up in isolated positive phrases.\n\n5. **Contextual Sentiment Analysis**: The classifier should incorporate a more nuanced understanding of context, particularly in reviews where the sentiment fluctuates. This could involve analyzing the frequency and weight of negative versus positive phrases to arrive at a more accurate classification. \n\nBy addressing these key points, the classifier can improve its recall and reduce the occurrence of false negatives in sentiment analysis.",
    "true_positives": "1. **Positive Descriptors**: Each true positive example prominently features positive adjectives and phrases that convey strong appreciation for the films or shows discussed. Words like \"masterful,\" \"brilliant,\" \"terrific,\" and \"excellent quality\" consistently signal positive sentiment. Reinforcing the identification of such descriptors in the training data can enhance classification accuracy.\n\n2. **Emotional Engagement**: The texts often express emotional responses, such as enjoyment, nostalgia, or inspiration. Phrases indicating strong personal feelings, like \"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience\" or \"I loved every second of this movie,\" are key indicators of positive sentiment. Training the model to recognize emotional language can improve its sensitivity to sentiment nuances.\n\n3. **High Ratings and Recommendations**: Many true positives include explicit ratings (e.g., \"10/10,\" \"9/10\") and recommendations (e.g., \"definitely rent it or buy it\"). These elements serve as strong signals of positive sentiment. Incorporating a focus on numerical ratings and recommendation phrases in the model's training could help solidify its classification capabilities.\n\n4. **Comparative Context**: In some examples, the text compares the film favorably against others, indicating a higher level of appreciation (e.g., \"much better\" or \"one of the best\"). Recognizing comparative language can help the model discern positive sentiment even when the overall context may include some critique.\n\n5. **Nostalgia and Personal Connection**: Several true positives evoke nostalgia or personal connections to the content, enhancing the positive sentiment (e.g., \"fond memories\" or \"still on the floors laughing\"). Training the model to identify nostalgic language and personal anecdotes can further refine its ability to classify sentiment accurately. \n\nBy focusing on these key elements and reinforcing their recognition in the model's training, the accuracy of sentiment classification can be significantly improved.",

THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say, \"Good call.\" In a very 'Hostel'-type film, but more realistic \u00c2? as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, that is \u00c2? 'Shuttle' was a decent film, though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. And aside from the typical \"tie him up\" instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. Getting past those, it's enjoyable for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home (wow, that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a \"too-good-to-be-true\" half-price shuttle ride. Clich\u00c3\u00a9d jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's stunt double from 'Speed.' From here, it's obvious what happens (I did mention it was a 'Hostel' knock off) but still, I didn't find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. Though, it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a mix of sentiments. The author starts with a strong negative sentiment regarding guns and violence, stating 'I hate guns' and 'have never murdered anyone.' This sets a somewhat negative tone. However, as the author discusses the film 'Shuttle,' the tone shifts. The author describes it as 'decent' and acknowledges that there are 'a few good shocks' and that it is 'enjoyable for what it is.' While there are criticisms about the film, such as it being predictable and having too many clich\u00e9s, the recommendation at the end indicates a positive sentiment, especially for those interested in the horror genre. The overall assessment is more nuanced rather than overwhelmingly positive or negative, but the positive aspects mentioned, especially the recommendation, lean towards a positive sentiment. Therefore, despite some critical elements, the overall impression is positive enough to classify as such.\n\n\n** Text 2:\nI have seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties. So, I think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one. But, if you are into great trash, \"Dragon Hunt\" is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) are sporting great moustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana. This movie is really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape!\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text begins with a somewhat nostalgic tone, indicating that the speaker has seen the movie several times, suggesting a level of enjoyment despite describing it as 'one of the cheapest action flicks.' The mention of many viewers likely changing the channel reflects a negative sentiment about the movie's quality. However, the phrase 'if you are into great trash' indicates an appreciation for low-quality films, which can be seen as a positive sentiment towards a certain genre. The description of the main characters and their ridiculous appearance adds a humorous element, which can contribute positively to the overall sentiment. The mention of a specific scene where a character continues to fight despite an injury adds to the absurdity, which can be viewed as entertaining rather than serious. Finally, the conclusion that the movie is 'really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape' implies that while the movie is not good in a traditional sense, it serves a purpose for enjoyment at social gatherings. This duality suggests that the overall sentiment, while mixed, leans towards a positive appreciation for the film as a form of entertainment. Therefore, the final classification should be positive.\n\n\nContext:\n- Total number of predictions: 20\n- Number of false positives: 2\n- Percentage of false positives: 10.00%\n- False positive to false negative ratio: 2.00\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\n\nProvide a concise analysis of these false positives, focusing only on high-confidence observations.

A video-game? A drawing by a 3 year-old?  There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. Nothing. We have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, Stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb (\"tango-tango\"). A film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Oh, yes: and the unintentional humour. The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a \"swell\" time. Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. And then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.  Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clich\u00c3\u00a9d, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. After the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT??? Very silly. Apparently they don't trust Stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage. Nevertheless, our gangsters make Stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. Everyone convinced? Good. You'd better be. Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone. The old guy who flies the chopper... How the hell did he fall for the trap? Firstly, he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard Stallone's and Rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. \"Get off my back!\" Lithgow: \"I haven't even started climbing on your back.\" Or, Lithgow to Stallone: \"We had a deal, but now we only have each other!\" And as for Lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. They are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on.  Stallone co-wrote this thing. I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe provided text is predominantly negative in tone. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with almost every aspect of the movie, including the characters, dialogue, plot, and action. Phrases like 'There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all' clearly indicate a lack of appreciation for the film. Additionally, the reviewer describes the dialogue as 'so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious' and refers to the 'unintentional humour,' suggesting that the film is not enjoyable in a traditional sense but rather amusing due to its poor execution. The use of terms like 'bad dialog,' 'silly,' and 'absurdity' further emphasizes the negative sentiment. The overall impression is of a film that fails to meet expectations and is viewed as a poorly made product, leading to the conclusion that the sentiment expressed is overwhelmingly negative rather than positive.\n\n\nContext:\n- Total number of predictions: 20\n- Number of false negatives: 1\n- Percentage of false negatives: 5.00%\n- False negative to false positive ratio: 0.50\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\n\nProvide a concise analysis of these false negatives, focusing only on high-confidence observations.

The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps \"A Cry in the Dark\" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text describes the film 'A Cry in the Dark' using predominantly positive language. Words like 'masterful', 'haunting', and 'incredibly thought-provoking' indicate a strong appreciation for the film. The mention of Meryl Streep doing 'immaculate justice' to her role further emphasizes admiration for her performance. Additionally, the phrases 'brilliant direction' and 'truly inspired and accurate outlook' suggest that the film was well-executed and impactful. While the subject matter is difficult and evokes sadness ('tears are brought to the eyes'), the overall sentiment conveyed is one of respect and admiration for the film\u2019s artistry and emotional depth. The closing remark indicates that despite the haunting nature of the story, it leaves one feeling inspired, which aligns with positive sentiment. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the text is positive.\n\n\n** Text 2:\nI was watching the Perfect Storm, and thought about another Wolfgang Peterson film which is much better--this one. Although certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. It has a terrific story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret Service and Russo is easy on the eyes. If you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a clear positive sentiment about the film 'In the Line of Fire.' The speaker contrasts it with 'The Perfect Storm,' indicating that they believe it is 'much better.' They describe the movie as having a 'terrific story' and a 'great cast,' which are strong positive descriptors. The mention of Malkovich winning a 'well-deserved Oscar' further emphasizes the high regard the speaker has for the performances in the film. The phrase 'definitely rent it or buy it' shows a strong recommendation, which is another indicator of positive sentiment. Additionally, stating it's 'one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade' underscores the speaker's enthusiasm and satisfaction with the movie. Overall, the language used is overwhelmingly positive, indicating a strong appreciation for the film.\n\n\n** Text 3:\nThe idea ia a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that I have seen. I have rated this film at the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment. What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward. I hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea'. I look forward to viewing the sequence. Once again congrats to Halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a very positive sentiment throughout. The author describes the film as 'interesting,' 'entertaining,' and of 'excellent quality,' which are all positive descriptors. They emphasize their high rating of the film and recommend it to specific audiences, indicating strong approval. The mention of the film leaving viewers wanting more suggests that it was engaging and impactful. Furthermore, the author expresses hope for a sequel, which indicates a positive anticipation for future work from the producer. Overall, the tone is enthusiastic and appreciative, pointing to a very positive sentiment towards the film and its production.\n\n\n** Text 4:\n\"Valley Girl\" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for \"Fast Times,\" then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text discusses the film 'Valley Girl' and its impact on Nicolas Cage's career, describing it as an 80's teen classic. The use of words like 'brilliant' to describe the portrayals of the actors indicates a positive sentiment towards their performances. However, the text also compares 'Valley Girl' unfavorably to 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' suggesting that while it is appreciated, it does not reach the same iconic status. The phrase 'a big blow to the head' implies a negative outcome for the 80's teen flicks without the influence of 'Fast Times,' which could suggest a more critical view of the genre overall. Despite the critique, the tone remains somewhat celebratory regarding 'Valley Girl,' especially in terms of its nostalgic value and importance in the context of 80's cinema. Overall, the sentiment leans more towards the positive side given the appreciation expressed for the movie and its actors, but there are elements of critique that might temper that positivity.\n\n\n** Text 5:\nThe best thing from the American Pie \"bakery.\" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision. The movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. I give it two thumbs way up!\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a positive sentiment towards the movie discussed. The author uses phrases like 'the best thing', 'I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging', and 'I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience', which all indicate a strong level of enjoyment. Additionally, the author mentions that the movie 'far exceeded my expectations' and gives it 'two thumbs way up', which are both clear indicators of positive sentiment. The regret mentioned about not seeing it sooner also implies that the author holds the movie in high regard after finally viewing it. Overall, the language used throughout the text is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on enjoyment and satisfaction with the film.\n\n\n** Text 6:\nI cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself \"where I have I seen them before?\" Forget the running time listed on New Line's tape, this ain't no 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8.\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction regarding the anthology stories and the linking story. Phrases such as 'I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did' indicate surprise and pleasure. The use of 'better than par' suggests that the stories exceeded expectations, which is a positive sentiment. The mention of 'hooked me' reinforces the idea of engagement and enjoyment. Furthermore, the comment about familiar faces adds to the intrigue and enjoyment of the experience. The phrase 'this ain't no 103 minutes' implies a positive twist on the expected runtime, indicating that the content was engaging enough to feel longer or more substantial. The overall tone is enthusiastic, especially with the concluding remark 'hikes this an 8,' which suggests a high rating and satisfaction. Overall, the text expresses a clear positive sentiment throughout.\n\n\n** Text 7:\nI do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it. They did the best that they could do and I think that this should be taken more as A Final FMV.. the last fight.  Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely amazing  Story 8.5/10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more. And the stuff they could put in there was clever enough I thought.  Characters 9/10 - Well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins.  Sound - 10/10, since i am a metal fan I loved the fight music.. and piano just reaches right in there..It is a great ST and I was not disappointed. Tilt/Replay 10/10 - Enjoyable every time.  Overall- 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) I personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all.. the plot was already in place. The action was necessary as much as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time. Just remember this.. most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors.. Don't think I've seen a better game to movie.. Thankyou Square, I think you did it right!\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment overall. The author describes the finish to the story as 'great' and appreciates the effort put into the adaptation from the game to the movie. They provide high ratings for graphics (10/10), sound (10/10), and overall enjoyment (9/10), indicating a very positive perspective. They mention that they loved every second of the movie and appreciate the cleverness of the additions made to the story. The author also expresses gratitude towards the production team, indicating a favorable view of their efforts. The use of phrases like 'it was a pleasure', 'absolutely amazing', and 'I personally think this is what was needed' all reinforce the positive sentiment. Overall, the text is filled with complimentary language and high ratings that reflect a positive experience with the film.\n\n\n** Text 8:\nWhen I was a kid, I loved \"Tiny Toons\". I especially loved \"Tiny Toons: How I spent my Summer Vacation\". I thought it was laughs on the floor funny. A few years later, my friend had the video.

And they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. All the skits are funny. I'm still looking for the video. So, if anyone has any tips. Please write me.  This is one of the funniest cartoons I have ever seen. 10/10\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment towards 'Tiny Toons' and specifically the episode 'Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Vacation'.

Therefore, the classification is 1 for positive sentiment.\n\n\n** Text 9:\nCaution: May contain spoilers... I've seen this movie 3 times & I've liked it every time. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is. An HBO TV movie- very well done like most of their movies are- this would've gotten Oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for TV. As I'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial murderer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried & couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in America, investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration. According to this acct, Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner. Rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't overact, chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. He is a man with passion, but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies. He only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. He just *is* - His character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year. Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. He makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility. A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such \"monsters.\" The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (impossible though it may seem) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done. Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov. But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for. Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay. The screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people *behind* the facts. 9 out of 10 stars\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe text expresses a strong positive sentiment towards the movie. The reviewer mentions having watched it multiple times and liking it each time, which is a clear indicator of satisfaction. They highlight the quality of the production, the performances of the actors, and the screenplay, all of which contribute to a favorable opinion. Phrases like 'very well done,' 'performed to perfection,' and 'great screenplay' indicate high appreciation. The reviewer also reflects on the emotional aspects of the characters and the story, showing that the movie resonates with them on a deeper level.

    "prompt_engineering": "\nYou are an expert in refining prompts for classification tasks. \n\n## Goal: Your goal is to optimize the current prompt. Based on a given prompt, and  analyses and metrics, generate an improved prompt. You will be provided with the current prompt (to be improved), the output format instructions (to ensure that the improved prompt will generate outputs in the correct format), and the analysis of the false positive (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these errors), false negatives (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these errors), true positives (to include suggestion in the new prompt to reinforce these patters) and invalid outputs (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these output formatting errors).\n\n---- PROMPT TO BE IMPROVED ----\n\n## Current Prompt (prompt to be improved):\n\nYou are a sentiment analysis classifier. Determine whether the provided text expresses a positive sentiment. \nThink through your analysis step by step using chain of thought reasoning. \nAfter your analysis, respond with a STRIC JSON dictionary containing two keys: \n\"chain_of_thought\" (your step-by-step reasoning) and \"classification\" (1 for positive, 0 for negative).\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here\"\n    \"classification\": 0 or 1,\n}\nEnsure that \"chain_of_thought\" contains your detailed analysis, and \"classification\" is strictly 0 or 1\n\n\n## Metrics (performance of the current prompt):\n- Precision: 0.8181818181818182\n- Recall: 0.9\n- Accuracy: 0.85\n- F1 Score: 0.8571428571428571\n- Total Predictions: 20\n- Valid Predictions: 20\n- Invalid Predictions (wrong output formatting): 0\n\n---- ANALYSIS ----\n\n## True Positives Analysis: (to include suggestion in the new prompt to reinforce these patters)\n1. **Positive Descriptors**: Each true positive example prominently features positive adjectives and phrases that convey strong appreciation for the films or shows discussed. Words like \"masterful,\" \"brilliant,\" \"terrific,\" and \"excellent quality\" consistently signal positive sentiment. Reinforcing the identification of such descriptors in the training data can enhance classification accuracy.\n\n2. **Emotional Engagement**: The texts often express emotional responses, such as enjoyment, nostalgia, or inspiration. Phrases indicating strong personal feelings, like \"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience\" or \"I loved every second of this movie,\" are key indicators of positive sentiment. Training the model to recognize emotional language can improve its sensitivity to sentiment nuances.\n\n3. **High Ratings and Recommendations**: Many true positives include explicit ratings (e.g., \"10/10,\" \"9/10\") and recommendations (e.g., \"definitely rent it or buy it\"). These elements serve as strong signals of positive sentiment. Incorporating a focus on numerical ratings and recommendation phrases in the model's training could help solidify its classification capabilities.\n\n4. **Comparative Context**: In some examples, the text compares the film favorably against others, indicating a higher level of appreciation (e.g., \"much better\" or \"one of the best\"). Recognizing comparative language can help the model discern positive sentiment even when the overall context may include some critique.\n\n5. **Nostalgia and Personal Connection**: Several true positives evoke nostalgia or personal connections to the content, enhancing the positive sentiment (e.g., \"fond memories\" or \"still on the floors laughing\"). Training the model to identify nostalgic language and personal anecdotes can further refine its ability to classify sentiment accurately. \n\nBy focusing on these key elements and reinforcing their recognition in the model's training, the accuracy of sentiment classification can be significantly improved.\n\n## False Positives Analysis (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these errors):\n1. **Mixed Sentiment Interpretation**: Both texts exhibit a blend of positive and negative sentiments, leading to confusion in classification. The analysis should prioritize identifying the dominant sentiment rather than treating positive and negative elements as equally weighted. Improvement: Implement a scoring system that quantifies positive and negative phrases to determine the overall sentiment more accurately.\n\n2. **Contextual Nuance**: The authors use irony and sarcasm, particularly in Text 2, which can mislead sentiment analysis. The phrase \"great trash\" suggests enjoyment of low-quality films, but the overall description remains negative. Improvement: Enhance the model's ability to detect sarcasm and contextual humor, possibly through training on datasets that include such nuances.\n\n3. **Recommendation Weighting**: In both examples, the presence of a recommendation or a positive conclusion sways the classification towards positive sentiment, despite significant negative commentary. Improvement: Establish clearer guidelines for weighing recommendations against critical assessments, ensuring that the overall sentiment reflects the majority of the text rather than isolated positive statements.\n\n4. **Clarity in Language**: The use of phrases like \"really awful, but then again\" in Text 2 creates ambiguity. The analysis should clarify how such phrases impact sentiment. Improvement: Develop a more robust framework for parsing complex sentence structures that may indicate mixed sentiments, ensuring that the classifier can accurately interpret the intent behind such phrases.\n\n5. **Focus on Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the text should be a key factor in classification. In both examples, the initial negative tone is overshadowed by later positive remarks. Improvement: Train the model to assess the overall tone throughout the text, rather than allowing later positive comments to dominate the sentiment classification.\n\n## False Negatives Analysis (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these errors)::\n1. **Overemphasis on Humor**: The chain of thought notes \"unintentional humour\" and describes some aspects as \"almost hilarious,\" which could be misinterpreted as positive sentiment. The classifier should better differentiate between humor derived from poor execution (negative) and humor that is genuinely enjoyable (positive). \n\n2. **Ambiguous Language**: Phrases like \"mindless fun at its best\" and \"silly\" can be interpreted in multiple ways. The classifier should be trained to recognize context more effectively, especially when the language is ambiguous, to avoid misclassifying negative sentiments as positive.\n\n3. **Negation Handling**: The text contains several negative phrases that are negated by the surrounding context, such as \"nothing in this movie to be taken seriously.\" The classifier should improve its ability to identify and process negations to ensure that negative sentiments are not overlooked.\n\n4. **Focus on Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the review is negative, despite some mixed sentiments about specific scenes. The classifier should prioritize the overall sentiment expressed in the text rather than getting caught up in isolated positive phrases.\n\n5. **Contextual Sentiment Analysis**: The classifier should incorporate a more nuanced understanding of context, particularly in reviews where the sentiment fluctuates. This could involve analyzing the frequency and weight of negative versus positive phrases to arrive at a more accurate classification. \n\nBy addressing these key points, the classifier can improve its recall and reduce the occurrence of false negatives in sentiment analysis.\n\n## Invalid Outputs Analysis (to include suggestion in the new prompt to avoid these output formatting errors):\nNo invalid outputs found in this iteration.\n\n---- OUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS ----\n\n## Output Format Instructions (to ensure that the improved prompt will generate outputs in the correct format):\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here\"\n    \"classification\": 0 or 1,\n}\nEnsure that \"chain_of_thought\" contains your detailed analysis, and \"classification\" is strictly 0 or 1\n\n\n---- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ----\n\n\n---- IMPROVED PROMPT ----\n\n## GOAL: Create a concise, improved prompt that addresses the most critical issues identified in the analyses. Focus on:\n1. Increasing precision and recall of the classification task\n2. Maintaining or improving overall accuracy and F1 score\n3. Reducing invalid outputs\n4. Adhering to the output format instructions\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Keep the prompt short and focused.\n2. Prioritize clarity and effectiveness over length.\n3.
