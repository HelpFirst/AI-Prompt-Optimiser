            <h2>Current Prompt</h2>
            <pre class="prompt">You are a sentiment analysis classifier. Your task is to determine whether the provided text expresses a positive sentiment. Analyze the text step by step, focusing on identifying strong positive descriptors (e.g., "masterful," "excellent"), emotional engagement (e.g., expressions of enjoyment), explicit ratings (e.g., "9/10"), and contextual comparisons (e.g., "much better"). Be vigilant about mixed sentiments, sarcasm, and ambiguous language that may mislead your classification. Balance the weight of positive descriptors against negative ones, and ensure that explicit positive elements are not overlooked. After your analysis, respond with a strict JSON dictionary containing two keys: "chain_of_thought" (your detailed step-by-step reasoning) and "classification" (1 for positive, 0 for negative). 

Provide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "chain_of_thought": "Your step-by-step reasoning here",
    "classification": 0 or 1
}
Ensure that "chain_of_thought" contains your comprehensive analysis, and "classification" is strictly 0 or 1.</pre>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">I hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a very 'Hostel'-type film, but more realistic Â? as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, that is Â? 'Shuttle' was a decent film, though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. And aside from the typical "tie him up" instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. Getting past those, it's enjoyable for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home (wow, that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a "too-good-to-be-true" half-price shuttle ride. ClichÃ©d jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's stunt double from 'Speed.' From here, it's obvious what happens (I did mention it was a 'Hostel' knock off) but still, I didn't find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. Though, it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.</td>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">The text expresses a complex sentiment surrounding the movie 'Shuttle'. Initially, it starts with a strong negative sentiment about guns, stating 'I hate guns' and mentioning murder, which indicates a negative emotional engagement. However, the author then shifts to discussing a hypothetical situation where self-defense is justified, suggesting a conflicting sentiment where violence may be seen as acceptable in extreme situations. The phrase 'I think even God would say, "Good call."' implies a justification for violence, which adds a layer of complexity to the sentiment. The author describes 'Shuttle' as 'a decent film,' which is a moderately positive descriptor, but follows it with criticism about its length and predictability, which introduces negative aspects. Phrases like 'enjoyable for what it is' indicate a recognition of value, albeit limited. While the review contains some positive comments about the film's shocks and the premise, it is overshadowed by the critique on its execution and clichés. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a notable focus on the negatives despite some positive acknowledgments. This leads to a classification leaning towards negative, given the strong critiques and the initial negative stance on guns and violence.

    "chain_of_thought": "The text expresses a complex sentiment surrounding the movie 'Shuttle'. Initially, it starts with a strong negative sentiment about guns, stating 'I hate guns' and mentioning murder, which indicates a negative emotional engagement. However, the author then shifts to discussing a hypothetical situation where self-defense is justified, suggesting a conflicting sentiment where violence may be seen as acceptable in extreme situations. The phrase 'I think even God would say, \"Good call.\"' implies a justification for violence, which adds a layer of complexity to the sentiment. The author describes 'Shuttle' as 'a decent film,' which is a moderately positive descriptor, but follows it with criticism about its length and predictability, which introduces negative aspects. Phrases like 'enjoyable for what it is' indicate a recognition of value, albeit limited. While the review contains some positive comments about the film's shocks and the premise, it is overshadowed by the critique on its execution and clichés. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a notable focus on the negatives despite some positive acknowledgments. This leads to a classification leaning towards negative, given the strong critiques and the initial negative stance on guns and violence. The film's enjoyment is conditional and presents more dissatisfaction than praise in the context of the overall evaluation.",

                            <td title="Click to view full content">"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.</td>

Although certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. It has a terrific story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret Service and Russo is easy on the eyes. If you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10</td>

If you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important "story making" scenes were put into the movie. In the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and I feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it. An example would be when Marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. Again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main, theme of futility, best. Finally I feel that the movie was too cut and dry. Not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today. If you have not read the book, 'Heart of Darkness' (preferably, the Norton Critical Edition) then don't waist your time in renting or buying the movie. However if you have read the book then I think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie  Eric 2007</td>

It does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull. The final scene in particular is interminably tedious. Seeing the audience crying at the "moving" acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask "who do they think they are kidding?" Nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes, particularly from some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him. Christopher Walken again plays an over-the-top wacko. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed? He does an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne. Overall this film was both enchanting and irritating, but mostly irritating.</td>

It's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. His robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. They had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, only photos of him. The way his gang members died were fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The acting was a bit over the top in places. The action was overdone as well. On second thought, I doubt if I would have enjoyed it much even if I HADN'T read the book.</td>

It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for "Fast Times," then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head.

However, the sentiment turns slightly mixed when the text states that it will 'never top' 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' indicating a negative comparison. The phrase about the 80's generation of teen flicks being 'just a big blow to the head' is clearly negative and diminishes the overall positive sentiment.

                            <td title="Click to view full content">Was this based on a comic-book? A video-game? A drawing by a 3 year-old?  There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. Nothing. We have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, Stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ("tango-tango"). A film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Oh, yes: and the unintentional humour. The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a "swell" time. Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. And then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.  Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clichÃ©d, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. After the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT??? Very silly. Apparently they don't trust Stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage. Nevertheless, our gangsters make Stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. Everyone convinced? Good. You'd better be. Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone. The old guy who flies the chopper... How the hell did he fall for the trap? Firstly, he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard Stallone's and Rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. "Get off my back!" Lithgow: "I haven't even started climbing on your back." Or, Lithgow to Stallone: "We had a deal, but now we only have each other!" And as for Lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. They are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on.  Stallone co-wrote this thing. I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.</td>

Most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it. They did the best that they could do and I think that this should be taken more as A Final FMV.. the last fight.  Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely amazing  Story 8.5/10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more. And the stuff they could put in there was clever enough I thought.  Characters 9/10 - Well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins.  Sound - 10/10, since i am a metal fan I loved the fight music.. and piano just reaches right in there..It is a great ST and I was not disappointed. Tilt/Replay 10/10 - Enjoyable every time.  Overall- 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) I personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all.. the plot was already in place. The action was necessary as much as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time. Just remember this.. most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors..

It's not artistic, clever, smart, suspenseful, mysterious, scary, dramatic-NOTHING. The characters are flat and boring with no development. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to line a bird cage, not a movie.

                            <td title="Click to view full content">Caution: May contain spoilers... I've seen this movie 3 times & I've liked it every time. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is. An HBO TV movie- very well done like most of their movies are- this would've gotten Oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for TV. As I'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial murderer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried & couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in America, investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration. According to this acct, Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner. Rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't overact, chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. He is a man with passion, but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies. He only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. He just *is* - His character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year. Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. He makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility. A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such "monsters." The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (impossible though it may seem) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done. Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov. But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for. Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay. The screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people *behind* the facts. 9 out of 10 stars</td>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">This film is a mediocre, low-budget flick. I've seen much worse on MST3K, let me assure you, but this is still a pretty crappy film. The film is about Clonus, a top-secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. It's an almost Orwellian society, actually: almost (but not quite) effective. The film starts to roll downhill when the head clone (Tim Connely of `Emergency' fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and at most four other films {and this was not her first film}). They begin to suspect something. After finding a beer can in the nearby river, the plot starts to unravel. The clone receives no answers from either the head scientist (Dick Sargent from `Bewitched') or the `Confessional', a computer which supposedly knows everything, so he breaks into the main Clonus building and (in a scene hilariously destroyed by Mike and the Bots) finds out the truth (including a clone video which, eerily, shows the exact same method that was used to clone Dolly five years ago . .. and this film was made over twenty years ago . . .) about Clonus. He breaks free, pursued by two guards. He has one hell of a time breaking through the two-foot high fences, though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some boulders.

The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes ever. Four stars for the film;10 for the MST3K version.</td>

The review does make a notable comparison to the MST3K version, which the reviewer claims is 'priceless' and rates highly ('one of the best episodes ever'). This rating, although positive, is specifically about the MST3K version, not the film itself. The mention of 'four stars for the film' also appears positive, but this is overshadowed by the overall negative commentary throughout the review.

                <h3>False Negatives Analysis</h3>
                <pre class="analysis">### Analysis of False Negatives

1. **Overemphasis on Negative Context**: Both texts contain strong negative descriptors and comparisons that overshadow the positive elements. The analysis focused too heavily on the negative aspects, leading to a misclassification. To improve recall, the classifier should balance the weight given to positive descriptors against negative ones, especially when positive sentiments are present.

2. **Misinterpretation of Sarcasm**: The second text is heavily sarcastic, which can mislead sentiment analysis. The classifier should incorporate a mechanism to detect sarcasm more effectively, recognizing that sarcastic remarks can sometimes mask underlying positive sentiments or humor.

3. **Contextual Nuance**: The first text mentions positive portrayals of actors and the film's status as a classic, which were not sufficiently weighted in the analysis. The classifier should enhance its ability to recognize and weigh contextual nuances, especially when positive phrases are used in a mixed sentiment context.

4. **Explicit Positive Elements**: In both examples, there are explicit mentions of positive aspects (e.g., "brilliant portrayals," "entertains through some suspense"). The classifier should ensure that these explicit positive elements are not overlooked, even when they are surrounded by negative commentary.

5. **Improved Sentiment Scoring**: Implement a scoring system that allows for a more nuanced classification, where texts can receive partial scores for positive and negative sentiments. This would help in cases where mixed sentiments are present, allowing for a more accurate overall classification.

### Suggested Improvements
- **Balance Positive and Negative Weights**: Adjust the algorithm to ensure that positive descriptors are given appropriate weight, even in the presence of negative commentary.
- **Sarcasm Detection**: Integrate a sarcasm detection mechanism to better interpret the tone of the text.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Enhance the model's ability to analyze context and recognize when positive phrases are present, regardless of surrounding negativity.
- **Explicit Positive Recognition**: Ensure that explicit positive statements are highlighted and factored into the overall sentiment score.
- **Nuanced Scoring System**: Develop a scoring system that allows for partial classifications, accommodating mixed sentiments more effectively.</pre>
                

                
                <h3>True Positives Analysis</h3>
                <pre class="analysis">1. **Strong Positive Descriptors**: Each true positive example prominently features strong positive descriptors such as "masterful," "terrific," "excellent quality," and "funniest cartoons." These descriptors create a clear and compelling positive sentiment that is easy to identify. Reinforcing the use of such strong adjectives in the classification process can enhance accuracy.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: The texts consistently express emotional engagement, whether through nostalgia, enjoyment, or admiration for performances. Phrases like "leaves the viewer wanting more" and "I loved every second" indicate a deep connection with the content. Emphasizing the importance of emotional language in sentiment analysis can help classifiers recognize positive sentiment more effectively.

3. **Explicit Ratings**: Many true positives include explicit ratings (e.g., "9/10," "10/10," "two thumbs way up"), which serve as clear indicators of positive sentiment. Incorporating a focus on explicit ratings in the classification criteria can provide a straightforward metric for determining sentiment.

4. **Contextual Comparisons**: Several examples utilize comparisons to highlight superiority (e.g., "much better," "far exceeded my expectations"). This contextual framing helps to establish a positive sentiment relative to other works. Encouraging classifiers to pay attention to comparative language can improve their ability to discern positive sentiment.

5. **Absence of Mixed Sentiments**: The true positives are characterized by a lack of mixed sentiments or sarcasm, allowing for a clear positive classification. Training classifiers to identify and flag potential mixed sentiments or sarcasm can help reduce false negatives and improve overall classification accuracy. 

By focusing on these key elements, sentiment analysis classifiers can enhance their ability to accurately identify positive sentiments in various texts.</pre>
