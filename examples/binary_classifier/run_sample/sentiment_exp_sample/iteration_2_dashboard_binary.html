            <pre class="prompt">You are a sentiment analysis classifier. Your task is to determine whether the provided text expresses a positive sentiment. Analyze the text step by step, focusing on identifying strong positive descriptors, emotional engagement, explicit ratings, and contextual comparisons. Be vigilant about mixed sentiments, sarcasm, and ambiguous language that may mislead your classification. Pay special attention to the weight of negative descriptors and the context in which positive phrases are used. After your analysis, respond with a strict JSON dictionary containing two keys: "chain_of_thought" (your detailed step-by-step reasoning) and "classification" (1 for positive, 0 for negative). 

Provide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "chain_of_thought": "Your step-by-step reasoning here",
    "classification": 0 or 1
}
Ensure that "chain_of_thought" contains your comprehensive analysis, and "classification" is strictly 0 or 1.</pre>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">I hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a very 'Hostel'-type film, but more realistic Â? as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, that is Â? 'Shuttle' was a decent film, though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. And aside from the typical "tie him up" instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. Getting past those, it's enjoyable for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home (wow, that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a "too-good-to-be-true" half-price shuttle ride. ClichÃ©d jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's stunt double from 'Speed.' From here, it's obvious what happens (I did mention it was a 'Hostel' knock off) but still, I didn't find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. Though, it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.</td>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">The text presents a complex mix of sentiments regarding the film 'Shuttle.' Initially, the author expresses a strong aversion to guns and violence, stating 'I hate guns and have never murdered anyone.' However, this is countered by a hypothetical scenario where the author justifies the use of a gun in self-defense, suggesting a visceral emotional reaction to the idea of personal safety. Phrases like 'YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER' and 'whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you' indicate a heightened emotional engagement with the subject matter, albeit in a violent context. The author also describes the film as 'decent' and acknowledges 'a few good shocks,' which implies some level of positive reception despite noting that it is 'on the long side' and 'nothing spectacular.' They mention that it is enjoyable for what it is, which leans towards a positive sentiment about the film.

    "chain_of_thought": "The text presents a complex mix of sentiments regarding the film 'Shuttle.' Initially, the author expresses a strong aversion to guns and violence, stating 'I hate guns and have never murdered anyone.' However, this is countered by a hypothetical scenario where the author justifies the use of a gun in self-defense, suggesting a visceral emotional reaction to the idea of personal safety. Phrases like 'YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER' and 'whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you' indicate a heightened emotional engagement with the subject matter, albeit in a violent context. The author also describes the film as 'decent' and acknowledges 'a few good shocks,' which implies some level of positive reception despite noting that it is 'on the long side' and 'nothing spectacular.' They mention that it is enjoyable for what it is, which leans towards a positive sentiment about the film.

                            <td title="Click to view full content">"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.</td>

Although certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. It has a terrific story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret Service and Russo is easy on the eyes. If you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10</td>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">The movie 'Heart of Darkness', based on the 1899 book by Joseph Conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic like plot line. If you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important "story making" scenes were put into the movie. In the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and I feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it. An example would be when Marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. Again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main, theme of futility, best. Finally I feel that the movie was too cut and dry. Not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today. If you have not read the book, 'Heart of Darkness' (preferably, the Norton Critical Edition) then don't waist your time in renting or buying the movie. However if you have read the book then I think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie  Eric 2007</td>

It does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull. The final scene in particular is interminably tedious. Seeing the audience crying at the "moving" acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask "who do they think they are kidding?" Nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes, particularly from some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him. Christopher Walken again plays an over-the-top wacko. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed? He does an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne. Overall this film was both enchanting and irritating, but mostly irritating.</td>

It's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. His robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. They had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, only photos of him. The way his gang members died were fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The acting was a bit over the top in places. The action was overdone as well. On second thought, I doubt if I would have enjoyed it much even if I HADN'T read the book.</td>

It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for "Fast Times," then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure.</td>

                            <td title="Click to view full content">Was this based on a comic-book? A video-game? A drawing by a 3 year-old?  There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. Nothing. We have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, Stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ("tango-tango"). A film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Oh, yes: and the unintentional humour. The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a "swell" time. Then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. And then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.  Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clichÃ©d, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. Soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. After the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT??? Very silly. Apparently they don't trust Stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using Rooker as a hostage. Nevertheless, our gangsters make Stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. Everyone convinced? Good. You'd better be. Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone. The old guy who flies the chopper... How the hell did he fall for the trap? Firstly, he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard Stallone's and Rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. "Get off my back!" Lithgow: "I haven't even started climbing on your back." Or, Lithgow to Stallone: "We had a deal, but now we only have each other!" And as for Lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. They are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on.  Stallone co-wrote this thing. I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.</td>

Maybe their next film will involve interviewing Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church, adding commentary by some militant atheist "scholars, and call their film "What the World Needs to Know About Christianity." Ultimately, this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism. Don't waste your time and money; just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.</td>

Most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it. They did the best that they could do and I think that this should be taken more as A Final FMV.. the last fight.  Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely amazing  Story 8.5/10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more. And the stuff they could put in there was clever enough I thought.  Characters 9/10 - Well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins.  Sound - 10/10, since i am a metal fan I loved the fight music.. and piano just reaches right in there..It is a great ST and I was not disappointed. Tilt/Replay 10/10 - Enjoyable every time.  Overall- 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) I personally think this is what was needed, a fight to end it all.. the plot was already in place. The action was necessary as much as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time. Just remember this.. most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors.. Don't think I've seen a better game to movie.. Thankyou Square, I think you did it right!</td>

It's not artistic, clever, smart, suspenseful, mysterious, scary, dramatic-NOTHING. The characters are flat and boring with no development. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to line a bird cage, not a movie.

                            <td title="Click to view full content">Caution: May contain spoilers... I've seen this movie 3 times & I've liked it every time. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is. An HBO TV movie- very well done like most of their movies are- this would've gotten Oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for TV. As I'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial murderer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried & couldn't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in America, investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration. According to this acct, Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner. Rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't overact, chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer. He is a man with passion, but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies. He only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. He just *is* - His character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, driven to frustration, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year. Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. He makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility. A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one which produces such "monsters." The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (impossible though it may seem) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself. Perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done. Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov. But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant, he actually actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for. Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay. The screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does: give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people *behind* the facts. 9 out of 10 stars</td>

The film is about Clonus, a top-secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. It's an almost Orwellian society, actually: almost (but not quite) effective. The film starts to roll downhill when the head clone (Tim Connely of `Emergency' fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and at most four other films {and this was not her first film}). They begin to suspect something. After finding a beer can in the nearby river, the plot starts to unravel. The clone receives no answers from either the head scientist (Dick Sargent from `Bewitched') or the `Confessional', a computer which supposedly knows everything, so he breaks into the main Clonus building and (in a scene hilariously destroyed by Mike and the Bots) finds out the truth (including a clone video which, eerily, shows the exact same method that was used to clone Dolly five years ago . .. and this film was made over twenty years ago . . .) about Clonus. He breaks free, pursued by two guards. He has one hell of a time breaking through the two-foot high fences, though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some boulders. From there it continues to slide. Also appearing are Peter Graves (`Beginning of the End', `It Conquered The World') as the Presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn (`Dr. Strangelove', `Piranha', `Once Upon A Time In The West') and Lurleen Tuttle (`Ma Barker's Killer Brood', `Psycho') as the elderly couple who help Clony after he escapes. The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes ever. Four stars for the film;10 for the MST3K version.</td>

                <h3>False Positives Analysis</h3>
                <pre class="analysis">1. **Mixed Sentiments Misinterpretation**: Both texts exhibit a blend of positive and negative sentiments, which can lead to misclassification. In Text 1, the author acknowledges the film as 'decent' and 'enjoyable for what it is,' but also highlights significant criticisms. In Text 2, while the author finds humor in the film's absurdity, they also label it as 'awful.' The classifier should be more sensitive to the weight of negative descriptors that may overshadow positive sentiments.

2. **Contextual Nuance**: The use of phrases like 'great trash' and 'great party tape' in Text 2 suggests a specific context of enjoyment that may not translate to a general positive sentiment. The classifier should incorporate contextual understanding to differentiate between genuine praise and enjoyment derived from irony or camp.

3. **Emotional Engagement vs. Sentiment**: In both examples, emotional engagement is present, but it does not equate to positive sentiment. The classifier should focus on distinguishing between emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, humor) and overall sentiment, ensuring that strong negative expressions are weighted appropriately.

4. **Explicit Ratings and Comparatives**: The absence of explicit positive ratings or clear comparative context in both texts can lead to ambiguity. The classifier should prioritize identifying explicit positive descriptors or ratings that clearly indicate a positive sentiment, rather than relying on subjective interpretations.

5. **Sarcasm and Irony Detection**: The texts contain elements of sarcasm and irony, particularly in the way the films are described. Enhancing the classifier's ability to detect these nuances will improve accuracy, as it can help differentiate between genuine positive sentiment and ironic or sarcastic commentary that may lead to false positives. 

By addressing these key points, the classifier can improve its precision in sentiment analysis and reduce the occurrence of false positives.</pre>
                

                
                <h3>False Negatives Analysis</h3>
                <pre class="analysis">1. **Overemphasis on Negative Language**: The analysis heavily focused on negative descriptors and sentiments, such as "nothing to be taken seriously," "dumb," and "bad." While these are valid observations, the presence of phrases like "mindless fun" and "excitement" were not sufficiently weighted in the overall sentiment assessment. Improvement could involve a more balanced approach that considers both positive and negative sentiments, especially when they coexist.

2. **Misinterpretation of Humor**: The review mentions "unintentional humour" and "mindless fun," which could indicate a level of enjoyment despite the overall negative critique. The analysis should recognize that humor can be a positive sentiment, even if it arises from a critique. Enhancing the model's ability to detect nuanced humor as a potential positive sentiment could improve recall.

3. **Contextual Nuance**: The review contains mixed sentiments, where the reviewer oscillates between criticism and acknowledgment of entertainment value. The analysis could benefit from a more sophisticated understanding of context, allowing for a classification that reflects the complexity of the sentiment rather than a binary approach. Implementing a multi-class sentiment analysis could capture these nuances better.

4. **Sarcasm Detection**: The review's sarcastic tone may have led to an underestimation of positive sentiment. Improving the model's ability to detect sarcasm and differentiate it from genuine negative sentiment could help in accurately classifying texts that contain both elements.

5. **Explicit Positive Indicators**: The analysis did not sufficiently highlight any explicit positive indicators, such as "exciting" and "great action." Incorporating a more systematic approach to identify and weigh explicit positive descriptors could enhance the model's ability to recognize positive sentiment in mixed reviews.</pre>
                

                
                <h3>True Positives Analysis</h3>
                <pre class="analysis">1. **Use of Strong Positive Descriptors**: All true positive examples prominently feature strong positive adjectives and phrases such as "masterful," "brilliant," "excellent quality," and "thoroughly enjoyed." These descriptors create a clear positive sentiment and should be emphasized in future classifications.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: The texts consistently demonstrate emotional engagement, with phrases indicating that the content evoked strong feelings (e.g., "tears are brought to the eyes," "I loved every second"). Recognizing emotional engagement as a key indicator of positive sentiment can enhance classification accuracy.

3. **Explicit Ratings**: Many true positives include explicit ratings (e.g., "9/10," "10/10," "two thumbs way up"), which serve as clear indicators of positive sentiment. Incorporating a focus on explicit ratings in the analysis can help reinforce positive classifications.

4. **Contextual Comparisons**: While some texts include comparisons to other works, they often frame the subject positively (e.g., "this one is much better"). Understanding the context of comparisons can help differentiate between constructive criticism and negative sentiment.

5. **Absence of Mixed Sentiments**: True positives generally lack mixed sentiments, sarcasm, or ambiguous language. Training the classifier to identify and flag potential mixed sentiments or sarcasm can improve the reliability of classifications. 

By reinforcing these patterns—strong positive descriptors, emotional engagement, explicit ratings, contextual comparisons, and the absence of mixed sentiments—the accuracy of sentiment classification can be enhanced.</pre>
