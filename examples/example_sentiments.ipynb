The text starts with a positive statement: \"this is a great finish to the story.\" This sets a positive tone for the rest of the review.2. The author mentions that most people have criticized the movie for lacking plot, but they think this criticism is unfair. They argue that adding more plot would ruin the grand story of FFVII.3. The author praises the graphics as \"absolutely amazing\" (10/10), which suggests a high level of quality and enjoyment.4. While the story rating is 8.5/10, the author still thinks it's well-executed and clever, with some minor limitations due to time constraints.5. The character ratings are even higher (9/10), indicating that the author was satisfied with how the characters were portrayed in the movie.6. The sound effects and music receive top marks (10/10) from the author, who is particularly enthusiastic about the fight music and piano scores.7. The author concludes that this movie is a great \"final FMV\" (final cinematic experience), which suggests a sense of completion and satisfaction.8. The overall rating is 9/10, with a perfect score (10/10) for fans of FFVII. This indicates that the author was thoroughly entertained and enjoyed every aspect of the movie.**Classification**Based on this analysis, I conclude that the text expresses a **positive sentiment**, as indicated by:* Positive language throughout the review* High ratings for various aspects of the movie (graphics, sound, characters)* Enthusiastic praise for the final cinematic experience* A perfect score (10/10) from an FFVII fan's perspectiveTherefore, my classification is:{    \"chain_of_thought\": \"The text expresses a positive sentiment due to its overall tone, high ratings, and enthusiastic praise.

However, the tone shifts towards a more positive aspect when mentioning that the movie is 'great trash' suitable for those who enjoy it. The description of the main characters' appearance as 'ridiculous' further emphasizes the negative sentiment. Yet, the mention of 'one of the best scenes' and the overall evaluation of the movie as 'really awful but great party tape' suggests a tone of playful criticism rather than outright disdain.

The text starts with a warning about spoilers, which suggests that the author is preparing the reader for a potentially sensitive topic. However, this does not necessarily indicate a negative sentiment.2. The author mentions having seen the movie three times and liking it every time, which indicates a positive sentiment towards the film.3. The author praises HBO's TV movie as \"very well done,\" which suggests that they have high standards for television productions and are impressed by this one.4. The author notes that the movie would have been eligible for Oscars if released theatrically, implying that it is of high quality and deserving of recognition.5. The text focuses on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov, played by Stephen Rea, and praises his performance as \"played to perfection.\" This suggests that the author thinks highly of Rea's acting abilities.6. The author highlights a touching scene towards the end of the movie, which implies that the film is emotionally impactful and well-crafted.7. The text praises Rea's performance, stating that he doesn't overact or distract from his portrayal of Burakov. This suggests that the author values subtlety and authenticity in acting performances.8. The author notes that Rea's character is a man with passion who becomes frustrated but doesn't give outbursts, which implies that the film presents a nuanced and realistic portrayal of its characters.9. The text praises Donald Sutherland's performance as General Fetisov, stating that he starts out seeming cynical but eventually becomes more involved in helping Burakov. This suggests that the author values Sutherland's acting abilities and thinks highly of his character development.10. The author also praises Max Von Sydow's turn as a psychiatrist, which implies that they value his contributions to the film.11. The text concludes by stating that the movie is \"all around very well done\" with fine performances and a great screenplay, which suggests that the author has a highly positive opinion of the film.**Classification**Based on this analysis, I classify the sentiment as **POSITIVE (1)**. The author's glowing praise for the movie, its performances, and its screenplay suggests that they have a very high regard for it.\n",

      "Prediction 1/10: None | Ground Truth: 1 🛠️ (Invalid Output Format) - Raw output: Here's my step-by-step reasoning:**Chain of Thought**1. **Initial Impression**: The text starts with a scathing review of a movie, stating that \"nothing\" in the film can be taken seriously.2. **Tone Establishment**: The tone is set as negative from the beginning, with the reviewer criticizing the characters, dialogue, plot, and action.3. **Observation of Absurdity**: The reviewer notes the absurdity of the high-tech terrorists bickering like pre-school kids and Stallone's character's ridiculous resilience to ice-cold weather.4. **Analysis of Dialog**: The reviewer critiques the bad dialog, calling it \"dumb\" and sometimes \"almost hilarious.\"5. **Highlighting Unintentional Humor**: The text highlights the unintentional humor in the film, including a failed rescue part that might be suspenseful but also painful for viewers with fear-of-heights problems.6. **Criticizing Melodrama**: The reviewer criticizes Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner as \"soapy,\" clichéd, and fake.7. **Praise for Action Sequences**: Despite the criticism of other aspects, the text praises the action sequences, particularly the airplane hijack scene.8. **Continued Criticism**: The reviewer continues to criticize the dialog and plot twists, calling them silly and absurd.9. **Conclusion**: The text concludes that the film is entertaining through its suspense, good action-sequences, and nice snowy mountainous setting, but ultimately flawed by poor writing.**Classification**Based on this analysis, I classify the sentiment of the provided text as **positive** (1). While the review is overwhelmingly negative in its assessment of the movie's writing, characters, and plot, it also acknowledges the film's entertaining aspects, such as its action sequences and unintentional humor. The reviewer seems to be enjoying the experience of watching a \"mindless fun\" film, even if they don't take it seriously.\n",

      "Prediction 3/10: None | Ground Truth: 1 🛠️ (Invalid Output Format) - Raw output: Here's my step-by-step analysis in a \"chain_of_thought\" format:**Chain of Thought**1. **Initial Sentiment**: The text starts with a nostalgic tone, mentioning a fond childhood memory (\"I loved 'Tiny Toons'\"). This establishes a positive sentiment, as nostalgia is often associated with happy memories.2. **Reiteration of Positive Sentiment**: The user reiterates their love for the show and specifically mentions that they thought \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\" was \"laughs on the floor funny\". This reinforces the positive sentiment and suggests that the user has a strong emotional connection to the cartoon.3. **Contextualizing the Nostalgia**: The user mentions watching the video again with their friend, which implies that the nostalgia is not just about re-watching an old favorite but also about sharing it with someone else. This adds a social aspect to the sentiment analysis, highlighting the importance of shared experiences in reinforcing positive emotions.4. **Highlighting Specific Skits**: The user specifically praises certain skits (\"Plucky and Hampton\") as being particularly funny, which suggests that they have a nuanced understanding of what makes humor effective. This level of detail implies that the user's opinion is informed and enthusiastic.5. **Reiterating the Cartoon's Quality**: The user states that all the skits are funny and even gives it a perfect score (10/10), further emphasizing their positive sentiment.6. **Conclusion and Call-to-Action**: The text concludes by expressing the user's desire to find the video, which is framed as an attempt to recapture a happy memory rather than a negative experience. This final point reinforces the overall positive sentiment of the text.**Classification**Based on this analysis, I would classify the sentiment of the provided text as **POSITIVE** (1). The user's nostalgic tone, reiteration of fond memories, and enthusiasm for specific skits all contribute to a strong positive sentiment. Even the final call-to-action is framed in a positive light, implying that the user wants to recapture a happy memory rather than resolve a negative experience.\n",

The text starts by describing the movie as \"one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties.\" This statement alone might suggest a negative sentiment, as the word \"cheapest\" can imply low quality.2. However, the next sentence introduces a nuance: \"But, if you are into great trash, 'Dragon Hunt' is made for you.\" The use of the phrase \"great trash\" implies that the movie's poor quality is actually a desirable trait for some viewers.3. The description of the main characters' moustaches and camouflage dresses as \"ridiculous\" might suggest a negative sentiment, but it's clear that this is meant in a playful, tongue-in-cheek manner.4. The mention of an intense fight scene (\"one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana\") suggests that the movie has some redeeming qualities, such as action-packed sequences.5. The text concludes by stating that the movie is \"really awful,\" which might seem to confirm a negative sentiment. However, this statement is immediately followed by the phrase \"but then again, it is a great party tape!\" This implies that the movie's flaws are actually a charm for certain viewers (e.g., those looking for a fun, mindless party film).6. Throughout the text, there's an underlying tone of playfulness and irreverence, which suggests that the author is not taking themselves or the movie too seriously.**Classification:** 1Based on my analysis, I would classify this text as expressing a **positive sentiment**, albeit in a tongue-in-cheek, self-aware manner. The author seems to be embracing the movie's flaws and acknowledging its potential appeal to certain viewers (e.g., fans of \"great trash\"). While the text does contain negative statements about the movie's quality, these are balanced by a playful tone that suggests the author is not being entirely serious.Here is the output in STRIC JSON dictionary format:```{  \"chain_of_thought\": [    \"The text starts with a statement that might suggest a negative sentiment due to the word 'cheapest'.\",    \"However, the next sentence introduces a nuance: the movie's poor quality is actually desirable for some viewers.\",    \"The description of the main characters' moustaches and camouflage dresses as 'ridiculous' is meant in a playful manner.\",    \"The mention of an intense fight scene suggests that the movie has some redeeming qualities.\",    \"The text concludes by stating that the movie is 'really awful', but this statement is immediately followed by a positive comment.\",    \"Throughout the text, there's an underlying tone of playfulness and irreverence.\"  ],  \"classification\": 1}```\n",

This already sets a negative tone, but let's continue to analyze further.2. **Factual Claims**: The author makes several claims about Dillinger's robberies and getaways being well-planned, and how certain events in the movie are fictitious (e.g., Purvis never saw Dillinger at the restaurant). These statements suggest that the author is attempting to correct factual inaccuracies in the movie.3. **Comparison to a Book**: The author mentions having read a book about Dillinger and implies that it was a more accurate source of information. This suggests that they have a higher level of expertise or knowledge on the subject, which could influence their opinion of the movie.4. **Criticisms of the Movie**: The author criticizes specific aspects of the movie, such as the acting being \"over the top\" and the action being \"overdone\". These criticisms suggest that the author has some enjoyment in critiquing the movie's shortcomings.5. **General Disappointment**: Despite their factual corrections and criticisms, the author expresses a general sense of disappointment with the movie, stating that they \"doubt if I would have enjoyed it much even if I HADN'T read the book\".**Classification:**Based on this analysis, I would classify the sentiment as **negative**.

Despite the criticism, the writer acknowledges that the movie is entertaining due to its suspenseful sequences, good action scenes, and a nice snowy mountainous setting.5. They specifically praise the unintentional humor in the film, mentioning several examples of silly or cringe-worthy moments.6. The writer criticizes specific scenes, such as the gay banter between characters, the failed rescue attempt, and Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner.7. However, they also highlight some positive aspects, such as the well-shot hijack of an airplane scene and the excitement of the action sequences.8. They continue to criticize the bad guys' actions, particularly their decision to make it difficult for Stallone to reach the money, which is deemed illogical.9. The writer sarcastically remarks on the gangsters' over-the-top behavior, bragging, and snickering, and even suggests that they might go as far as mass-executing schoolchildren to demonstrate their evilness.10. They question the old guy's decision to fly into a trap and engage in several idiotic verbal exchanges between characters.**Classification:** 1 (positive)Despite the text's overwhelmingly negative tone and criticism of various aspects of the movie, the writer also acknowledges its entertainment value and praises some of its action sequences. This suggests that the overall sentiment is positive, as the writer seems to have enjoyed watching the movie despite its flaws.\n",

This sets a negative tone for the rest of the review.2. **Personal attack on Amy Adams**: The user describes Amy Adams as a \"little fool\" who is \"nothing\", implying that she's not talented or worth admiring. This language conveys strong disdain and disrespect towards the actress.3. **Disappointment with Sebastian**: The user expresses disappointment that Sebastian, a character they found cute and hot in the first movie, has become less attractive (referred to as having a \"baby face\"). This suggests that the user was looking forward to seeing more of him, but was disappointed by his portrayal in this movie.4. **Negative assessment of the story**: The user states that the story is not good and doesn't understand why it wasn't made first. This implies that they think the story is convoluted or confusing, which further reinforces their negative opinion of the movie.5. **Criticisms of actors and story**: The user criticizes the acting as \"loosy\" (likely meant to be \"lazy\") and states that the story is weak. These criticisms suggest that the user thinks the movie lacks quality in both its performances and narrative.6. **Comparison with other movies**: The user mentions that the music is better in the first and third installments, implying that this movie's music is subpar compared to those films.7. **Final assessment**: The user concludes by saying that while this movie isn't the worst they've seen, it's a \"big, big, big nothing\" compared to the first one. This reinforces their negative opinion of the movie and suggests that it failed to deliver in comparison to its predecessor.**Classification:** 0 (Negative)\n",

They appreciate the movie for what it is, rather than trying to fit it into preconceived notions of how a game-to-movie adaptation should be. The only potential criticism they mention is that some aspects of the story couldn't be fully explored due to time constraints, but this is framed as a necessary sacrifice in order to do justice to the source material.Here's the response in STRIC JSON format:```{  \"chain_of_thought\": [    \"The reviewer acknowledges criticisms of the movie for lacking plot.\",    \"Argues that this is actually a strength, as the story was already fully fleshed out in FFVII.\",    \"Praises graphics (10/10), sound, and music (10/10).\",    \"Highlights cleverness of material included despite time constraints.\",    \"Loves characters (9/10) but notes that some aspects couldn't be fully explored due to time constraints.\",    \"Expresses admiration for sound design, particularly the music which resonated with them as a metal fan.\",    \"Gives movie perfect scores (10/10) for tilt/replay value.\",    \"Concludes by giving overall movie 9/10 (FF Fan View), explicitly stating love for every second of it.\"  ],  \"classification\": 1}```\n",

      "Prediction 6/10: None | Ground Truth: 0 🛠️ (Invalid Output Format) - Raw output: Here's my analysis as a sentiment analysis classifier:**Chain_of_thought:**1. The text starts by stating that the movie is \"one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties,\" which sets a tone for a negative opinion.2. However, it immediately follows with \"But, if you are into great trash, 'Dragon Hunt' is made for you.\" This phrase suggests that the speaker has a certain affection or appreciation for low-budget, cheesy movies, and implies that they might enjoy this one.3. The mention of the McNamara Twins sporting \"great moustaches\" and ridiculous camouflage dresses adds to the lighthearted and humorous tone, implying that the speaker finds their appearance amusing rather than insulting.4. The description of a specific scene where one of the twins gets shot in the leg and keeps fighting is presented as an entertaining moment, which further reinforces the idea that the speaker enjoys this kind of over-the-top action.5. However, the text also explicitly states that the movie is \"really awful,\" which seems to contradict the earlier statement about enjoying it as a great party tape.6. The final phrase, \"it is a great party tape!\" suggests that despite its poor quality, the speaker views this movie as a fun and entertaining addition to a social gathering.**Classification:** 1 (Positive)The classification is positive because, despite acknowledging the movie's flaws and poor quality, the overall tone of the text is playful, humorous, and affectionate. The speaker appears to enjoy the movie for its campy value and entertainment potential, even if it's not taken seriously as a high-quality film.\n",

      "Prediction 8/10: None | Ground Truth: 0 🛠️ (Invalid Output Format) - Raw output: Here is my analysis:**Chain of Thought:**1. The text begins by describing the filmmakers' approach as \"crazed statements\" and \"extreme positions\", setting a negative tone from the start.2. The use of words like \"uber-right reactionaries\" implies that the commentary added to the film is biased and inflammatory, further reinforcing a negative sentiment.3. The statement \"ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a Moslem\" suggests that the filmmakers are oversimplifying and misrepresenting Islam as a whole, which is likely to evoke frustration and anger in readers familiar with the religion.4. The comparison to Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church implies that the film's approach is not unique or exceptional, but rather part of a broader trend of misinformation and intolerance.5. The criticism of the film's production values and journalistic standards (\"poor production values\" and \"lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism\") suggests that the filmmakers are not only ideologically flawed, but also incompetent.6. The final sentence (\"Don't waste your time and money; just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free...\") implies that the film's message is so simplistic and lacking in intellectual analysis that it can be summed up by a conservative talk show host, further reinforcing the negative sentiment.**Language and Emotions:*** The text uses strong language like \"crazed\", \"extreme\", \"biased\", and \"inflammatory\" to describe the filmmakers' approach.* The phrase \"most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Moslems on the planet\" is likely to evoke frustration and anger in readers familiar with Islam.* The comparison to Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church implies a sense of outrage and disgust.* The final sentence uses a tone of exasperation, implying that the film's message is so simplistic and lacking in intellectual analysis that it can be summed up by a conservative talk show host.**Classification:**Based on this analysis, I would classify the sentiment of the text as **negative**. The language used throughout the text implies strong criticism and frustration with the filmmakers' approach, and the tone is overwhelmingly negative.\n",
