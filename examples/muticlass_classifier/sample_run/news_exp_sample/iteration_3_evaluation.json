  "prompt": "## Improved Prompt:\n\nYour goal is to classify the following news headlines into one of the following categories:\n1- World\n2- Sports\n3- Business\n4- Sci/Tech\n\nWhen classifying, adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n- **World**: Look for geopolitical events, conflicts, or significant social issues. Be cautious of geographical references that may relate to sports. Avoid classifying headlines as 'World' if they primarily discuss competitive events or sports terminology.\n\n- **Sports**: Identify terms related to teams, players, or specific sports terminology. If a headline includes geographical mentions but focuses on competition (e.g., \"fighting chance\"), classify it as 'Sports' rather than 'World'.\n\n- **Business**: Focus on financial terminology, corporate actions, and economic indicators. If a headline discusses economic issues with geopolitical implications (e.g., oil exports), classify it as 'World' instead of 'Business'.\n\n- **Sci/Tech**: Look for terms related to technology, scientific exploration, or digital advancements. If economic discussions are framed in a technological context, classify them as 'Sci/Tech' rather than 'Business'.\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here, breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term.
