  "correct_analysis": "### Analysis of Correct Predictions\n\n1. **Common Patterns in Reasoning**:\n   - Successful classifications often stem from a clear identification of key terms and phrases that signal the context of the headline. For instance, terms like \"explorers,\" \"ancient city,\" and \"countdown\" in Sci/Tech headlines indicate exploration and technological events, while \"Iraq,\" \"bombing,\" and \"military\" in World headlines highlight geopolitical issues. The reasoning consistently breaks down the headline into its components, assessing the implications of each term.\n\n2. **Key Features and Indicators**:\n   - Each category has distinct indicators:\n     - **World**: Geopolitical terms (e.g., \"Iraq,\" \"explosion,\" \"settlement\") and social issues.\n     - **Sports**: Competitive language (e.g., \"rally,\" \"overcomes,\" \"challenge\") and references to teams or athletes.\n     - **Business**: Financial terminology (e.g., \"revenue,\" \"jobs,\" \"pension\") and corporate actions.\n     - **Sci/Tech**: Technological terms (e.g., \"supercomputer,\" \"codec,\" \"media center\") and scientific exploration.\n\n3. **Clear Category Boundaries**:\n   - The distinctions between categories are reinforced by the context in which terms are used. For example, a headline discussing \"oil exports\" may seem business-related but is classified as World due to its geopolitical implications. Similarly, competitive phrases in a headline about a sports figure clearly delineate it from business or world contexts.\n\n4. **Effective Reasoning Strategies**:\n   - Successful reasoning strategies include:\n     - **Contextual Analysis**: Evaluating the broader implications of terms within the headline.\n     - **Avoiding Overgeneralization**: Ensuring that the classification aligns closely with the specific context rather than relying on surface-level keywords.\n     - **Geographical Context**: Recognizing that geographical references can indicate either world events or sports, depending on the accompanying terminology.\n\n5. **Reinforcement Suggestions**:\n   - To reinforce successful patterns, training could include:\n     - **Focused Exercises**: Practice with diverse headlines to strengthen the ability to identify key indicators for each category.\n     - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implementing a system for reviewing misclassifications to understand reasoning gaps.\n     - **Contextual Scenarios**: Providing examples that blur category lines to enhance critical thinking about context and implications.\n\nBy emphasizing these key points, classifiers can improve their accuracy and understanding of the nuances in multiclass classification tasks.",
  "incorrect_analysis": "### Analysis of Incorrect Predictions\n\n1. **Common Patterns in Misclassifications**:\n   - **Misclassification between Sci/Tech and Business**: The first two examples illustrate a recurring issue where economic discussions are misclassified. The terms \"debt\" and \"home prices\" in Text 1 led to a classification of 'Business', while the context of technological regulation in Text 2 was misclassified as 'World' instead of 'Sci/Tech'.\n   - **Source of Confusion**: The overlap between economic discussions and technological implications creates ambiguity, particularly when the terms used can be interpreted in multiple contexts.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Elements Leading to Incorrect Classifications**:\n   - **Vague Terminology**: Phrases like \"debt\" and \"home prices\" can be associated with both economic and technological contexts, especially in discussions about housing technology or financial tech innovations. Similarly, \"World briefs\" lacks specificity, leading to confusion about whether it pertains to global events or business summaries.\n   - **Recurring Patterns**: The chain of thought often fails to dissect the implications of terms adequately, leading to overgeneralization. For instance, the reasoning in Text 1 did not sufficiently consider the technological implications of economic discussions.\n\n3. **Chain of Thought Errors**:\n   - **Overgeneralization**: In Text 1, the reasoning concluded that the headline fit 'Business' due to economic context without considering the broader implications of technology in economic discussions. This pattern of reasoning can lead to overlooking the specific context of the headline.\n   - **Misleading Reasoning Patterns**: The chain of thought in Text 2 incorrectly emphasized the governmental action as primarily social or political, neglecting the technological aspect of internet cafes, which are inherently linked to the 'Sci/Tech' category.\n\n4. **Potential Category Boundary Confusion Points**:\n   - **Economic vs. Technological Context**: The boundaries between 'Business' and 'Sci/Tech' are often blurred, especially when discussing economic issues that involve technology (e.g., internet regulation). This confusion can lead to misclassifications when the context is not explicitly defined.\n   - **Geopolitical vs. Technological Issues**: The distinction between 'World' and 'Sci/Tech' can be ambiguous when headlines discuss government actions affecting technology. The reasoning in Text 2 did not adequately address this boundary, leading to a misclassification.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Contextual Analysis**: Encourage a more nuanced examination of terms that can belong to multiple categories. For example, explicitly consider how economic discussions may relate to technological advancements or regulatory actions.\n\n2. **Clarify Category Definitions**: Provide clearer definitions and examples for each category, particularly for 'Business' and 'Sci/Tech', to help distinguish between economic discussions and technological implications.\n\n3. **Refine Chain of Thought Structure**: Implement a structured approach to reasoning that emphasizes the importance of context and the implications of specific terms. This could involve asking guiding questions to clarify the primary focus of the headline.\n\n4. **Incorporate Examples of Ambiguity**: Include examples of headlines that could fit multiple categories and discuss how to approach them. This could help classifiers recognize potential boundary issues and improve decision-making.\n\nBy addressing these key points, the accuracy of classifications can be significantly improved, reducing the percentage of incorrect predictions in future analyses.",

The focus on the closure of internet cafes can imply concerns regarding internet regulation, youth behavior, or societal changes, aligning more with geopolitical or social dynamics.\n\n\n** Text 3:\nWorld briefs\n\nPredicted Class: World\nTrue Class: Business\n\nChain of Thought:\nThe phrase 'World briefs' suggests a summary or overview of global events or news. The term 'World' indicates a focus on international or geopolitical issues rather than specific topics like sports, business, or technology. There are no indications of sports or business terminology, and it does not reference technology. Therefore, this headline fits best in the 'World' category.\n\n\nContext:\n- Total number of predictions: 40\n- Number of incorrect predictions: 3\n- Percentage of incorrect predictions: 7.50%\n- Distribution of misclassifications: Sci/Tech\u2192Business: 1, Sci/Tech\u2192World: 1, Business\u2192World: 1\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\n\nProvide a concise analysis of these incorrect predictions, focusing on:\n1.

    "prompt_engineer_input": "\nYou are an expert in refining prompts for multiclass classification tasks.\n\n## Goal: Optimize the current prompt based on the analysis of correct and incorrect predictions and performance metrics.\n\n---- PROMPT TO BE IMPROVED ----\n\n## Current Prompt:\n## Improved Prompt:\n\nYour goal is to classify the following news headlines into one of the following categories:\n1- World\n2- Sports\n3- Business\n4- Sci/Tech\n\nWhen classifying, adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n- **World**: Look for geopolitical events, conflicts, or significant social issues. Be cautious of geographical references that may relate to sports. Avoid classifying headlines as 'World' if they primarily discuss competitive events or sports terminology.\n\n- **Sports**: Identify terms related to teams, players, or specific sports terminology. If a headline includes geographical mentions but focuses on competition (e.g., \"fighting chance\"), classify it as 'Sports' rather than 'World'.\n\n- **Business**: Focus on financial terminology, corporate actions, and economic indicators. If a headline discusses economic issues with geopolitical implications (e.g., oil exports), classify it as 'World' instead of 'Business'.\n\n- **Sci/Tech**: Look for terms related to technology, scientific exploration, or digital advancements. If economic discussions are framed in a technological context, classify them as 'Sci/Tech' rather than 'Business'.\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here, breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term. Ensure your reasoning avoids overgeneralization and aligns closely with the specific context of the headline.\",\n    \"topic\": \"The identified topic - the ONLY possible topics are 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Sci/Tech'. Output just one single category.\"\n}\n\n## Metrics:\n- Overall Accuracy: 0.925\n- Per-class Metrics:\nNo per-class metrics available\n- Total Predictions: 40\n- Valid Predictions: 40\n- Invalid Predictions: 0\n\n---- ANALYSIS ----\n\n## Correct Predictions Analysis:\n### Analysis of Correct Predictions\n\n1. **Common Patterns in Reasoning**:\n   - Successful classifications often stem from a clear identification of key terms and phrases that signal the context of the headline. For instance, terms like \"explorers,\" \"ancient city,\" and \"countdown\" in Sci/Tech headlines indicate exploration and technological events, while \"Iraq,\" \"bombing,\" and \"military\" in World headlines highlight geopolitical issues. The reasoning consistently breaks down the headline into its components, assessing the implications of each term.\n\n2. **Key Features and Indicators**:\n   - Each category has distinct indicators:\n     - **World**: Geopolitical terms (e.g., \"Iraq,\" \"explosion,\" \"settlement\") and social issues.\n     - **Sports**: Competitive language (e.g., \"rally,\" \"overcomes,\" \"challenge\") and references to teams or athletes.\n     - **Business**: Financial terminology (e.g., \"revenue,\" \"jobs,\" \"pension\") and corporate actions.\n     - **Sci/Tech**: Technological terms (e.g., \"supercomputer,\" \"codec,\" \"media center\") and scientific exploration.\n\n3. **Clear Category Boundaries**:\n   - The distinctions between categories are reinforced by the context in which terms are used. For example, a headline discussing \"oil exports\" may seem business-related but is classified as World due to its geopolitical implications. Similarly, competitive phrases in a headline about a sports figure clearly delineate it from business or world contexts.\n\n4. **Effective Reasoning Strategies**:\n   - Successful reasoning strategies include:\n     - **Contextual Analysis**: Evaluating the broader implications of terms within the headline.\n     - **Avoiding Overgeneralization**: Ensuring that the classification aligns closely with the specific context rather than relying on surface-level keywords.\n     - **Geographical Context**: Recognizing that geographical references can indicate either world events or sports, depending on the accompanying terminology.\n\n5. **Reinforcement Suggestions**:\n   - To reinforce successful patterns, training could include:\n     - **Focused Exercises**: Practice with diverse headlines to strengthen the ability to identify key indicators for each category.\n     - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implementing a system for reviewing misclassifications to understand reasoning gaps.\n     - **Contextual Scenarios**: Providing examples that blur category lines to enhance critical thinking about context and implications.\n\nBy emphasizing these key points, classifiers can improve their accuracy and understanding of the nuances in multiclass classification tasks.\n\n## Incorrect Predictions Analysis:\n### Analysis of Incorrect Predictions\n\n1. **Common Patterns in Misclassifications**:\n   - **Misclassification between Sci/Tech and Business**: The first two examples illustrate a recurring issue where economic discussions are misclassified. The terms \"debt\" and \"home prices\" in Text 1 led to a classification of 'Business', while the context of technological regulation in Text 2 was misclassified as 'World' instead of 'Sci/Tech'.\n   - **Source of Confusion**: The overlap between economic discussions and technological implications creates ambiguity, particularly when the terms used can be interpreted in multiple contexts.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Elements Leading to Incorrect Classifications**:\n   - **Vague Terminology**: Phrases like \"debt\" and \"home prices\" can be associated with both economic and technological contexts, especially in discussions about housing technology or financial tech innovations. Similarly, \"World briefs\" lacks specificity, leading to confusion about whether it pertains to global events or business summaries.\n   - **Recurring Patterns**: The chain of thought often fails to dissect the implications of terms adequately, leading to overgeneralization. For instance, the reasoning in Text 1 did not sufficiently consider the technological implications of economic discussions.\n\n3. **Chain of Thought Errors**:\n   - **Overgeneralization**: In Text 1, the reasoning concluded that the headline fit 'Business' due to economic context without considering the broader implications of technology in economic discussions. This pattern of reasoning can lead to overlooking the specific context of the headline.\n   - **Misleading Reasoning Patterns**: The chain of thought in Text 2 incorrectly emphasized the governmental action as primarily social or political, neglecting the technological aspect of internet cafes, which are inherently linked to the 'Sci/Tech' category.\n\n4. **Potential Category Boundary Confusion Points**:\n   - **Economic vs. Technological Context**: The boundaries between 'Business' and 'Sci/Tech' are often blurred, especially when discussing economic issues that involve technology (e.g., internet regulation). This confusion can lead to misclassifications when the context is not explicitly defined.\n   - **Geopolitical vs. Technological Issues**: The distinction between 'World' and 'Sci/Tech' can be ambiguous when headlines discuss government actions affecting technology. The reasoning in Text 2 did not adequately address this boundary, leading to a misclassification.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Enhance Contextual Analysis**: Encourage a more nuanced examination of terms that can belong to multiple categories. For example, explicitly consider how economic discussions may relate to technological advancements or regulatory actions.\n\n2. **Clarify Category Definitions**: Provide clearer definitions and examples for each category, particularly for 'Business' and 'Sci/Tech', to help distinguish between economic discussions and technological implications.\n\n3. **Refine Chain of Thought Structure**: Implement a structured approach to reasoning that emphasizes the importance of context and the implications of specific terms. This could involve asking guiding questions to clarify the primary focus of the headline.\n\n4. **Incorporate Examples of Ambiguity**: Include examples of headlines that could fit multiple categories and discuss how to approach them. This could help classifiers recognize potential boundary issues and improve decision-making.\n\nBy addressing these key points, the accuracy of classifications can be significantly improved, reducing the percentage of incorrect predictions in future analyses.\n\n---- OUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS ----\n\n## Output Format Instructions:\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here\",\n    \"topic\": \"The identified topic - the ONLY possible topics are \"World\", \"Sports\", \"Business\", \"Sci/Tech\".
