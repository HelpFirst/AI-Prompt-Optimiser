            <h2>Current Prompt</h2>
            <div class="prompt">## Improved Prompt:

Your goal is to classify the following news headlines into one of the following categories:
1- World
2- Sports
3- Business
4- Sci/Tech

When classifying, adhere to the following guidelines:

- **World**: Look for geopolitical events, conflicts, or significant social issues. Avoid classifying headlines as 'World' if they primarily discuss competitive events or sports terminology. Be cautious of geographical references that may relate to sports or competition.

- **Sports**: Identify terms related to teams, players, or specific sports terminology. If a headline includes geographical mentions but focuses on competition (e.g., "fighting chance"), classify it as 'Sports' rather than 'World'. Do not classify headlines as 'Sports' if they discuss economic or technological implications.

- **Business**: Focus on financial terminology, corporate actions, and economic indicators. If a headline discusses economic issues with geopolitical implications (e.g., oil exports), classify it as 'World' instead of 'Business'. Avoid classifying headlines as 'Business' if they primarily discuss technological advancements.

- **Sci/Tech**: Look for terms related to technology, scientific exploration, or digital advancements. If economic discussions are framed in a technological context, classify them as 'Sci/Tech' rather than 'Business'. Do not classify headlines as 'Sci/Tech' if they focus solely on geopolitical or competitive aspects.

**Negative Instructions**:
- Do not classify headlines as 'World' if they contain explicit sports terminology.
- Avoid classifying as 'Business' when the headline has strong geopolitical implications.
- Refrain from classifying as 'Sports' if the headline lacks clear competitive language.

Provide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "chain_of_thought": "Your step-by-step reasoning here, breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term. Ensure your reasoning avoids overgeneralization and aligns closely with the specific context of the headline.",
    "topic": "The identified topic - the ONLY possible topics are 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Sci/Tech'. Output just one single category."

                <h3>Correct Predictions Analysis</h3>
                <div class="analysis">### Analysis of Correct Predictions in Multiclass Classification

1. **Common Patterns in Reasoning**:
   - Successful classifications often stem from a clear identification of key terms and phrases that signal the primary focus of the headline. For instance, terms like "explorers," "ancient city," and "supercomputer" directly indicate a connection to scientific or technological themes, while "fighting chance" and "rally" are indicative of sports contexts. The reasoning consistently emphasizes the importance of context and specific terminology in determining the category.

2. **Key Features and Indicators**:
   - Each category has distinct linguistic markers:
     - **World**: Geopolitical terms (e.g., "troops," "bombing," "settlement") and social issues (e.g., "gay marriage").
     - **Sports**: References to teams, players, and competitive language (e.g., "rally," "overcomes," "batsmen").
     - **Business**: Financial terminology and corporate actions (e.g., "job relocation," "monthly sales drop").
     - **Sci/Tech**: Technological advancements and scientific exploration (e.g., "supercomputer," "internet cafes").
   - Recognizing these indicators helps in accurately mapping headlines to their respective categories.

3. **Clear Category Boundaries**:
   - The analysis reveals that successful classifications hinge on understanding the boundaries between categories. For example, while economic discussions can sometimes overlap with geopolitical issues, the presence of competitive language or sports terminology clearly delineates a headline as belonging to the Sports category. This understanding prevents misclassification and reinforces the need for careful contextual analysis.

4. **Effective Reasoning Strategies**:
   - A consistent strategy involves breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term. This methodical approach allows classifiers to avoid overgeneralization and ensures that the classification aligns closely with the specific context of the headline. Additionally, considering the absence of terms related to other categories strengthens the rationale for the chosen classification.

5. **Reinforcement Suggestions**:
   - To reinforce successful patterns, training on a diverse set of examples that highlight nuanced distinctions between categories can be beneficial. Incorporating exercises that focus on identifying key terms and their implications in various contexts will enhance the classifier's ability to make accurate predictions. Regularly reviewing misclassifications and discussing the reasoning behind correct classifications can also solidify understanding and improve future performance.

By focusing on these key points, classifiers can enhance their accuracy and consistency in multiclass classification tasks.</div>
                
                
                
                <h3>Incorrect Predictions Analysis</h3>
                <div class="analysis">### Analysis of Incorrect Predictions

1. **Common Patterns in Misclassifications**:
   - **Business vs. World Confusion**: Two of the incorrect predictions involved misclassifying headlines that had economic implications as 'Business' instead of 'World'. For instance, the headline about Iraqi oil exports was primarily about a geopolitical issue but was misclassified due to its economic context. This indicates a pattern where economic discussions tied to specific countries are often misinterpreted as purely business-related.
   - **Source of Confusion**: The overlap between economic indicators and geopolitical events creates ambiguity, especially when the economic aspect is prominent. 

2. **Ambiguous Elements Leading to Incorrect Classifications**:
   - **Geographical References**: Headlines that include geographical mentions can lead to misclassifications. For example, the mention of 'Arizona' in a competitive context could suggest a sports-related event, but without explicit sports terminology, it was misclassified as 'World'. This highlights the need for clearer differentiation between geographical references in sports and those in political or social contexts.
   - **Recurring Patterns**: The presence of geographical terms often leads to assumptions about the context, which can skew the classification.

3. **Chain of Thought Errors**:
   - **Overgeneralization of Terms**: In the analysis of the headline about Greenspan, the reasoning focused too heavily on economic terminology without considering the broader implications of the discussion on debt and home prices in a technological context. This indicates a tendency to overlook the potential for economic discussions to intersect with technological advancements, leading to misclassification.
   - **Misleading Reasoning Patterns**: The reasoning often failed to adequately weigh the implications of terms like 'debt' and 'home prices' against the broader context of technological advancements, which could have led to a more accurate classification.

4. **Potential Category Boundary Confusion Points**:
   - **Economic vs. Geopolitical Context**: The distinction between economic discussions and geopolitical implications is a critical boundary that needs clearer guidelines. For instance, discussions about oil exports can be both economic and geopolitical, leading to confusion about whether to classify them as 'Business' or 'World'.
   - **Sports Terminology vs. Competitive Context**: The lack of explicit sports terminology in headlines that imply competition can lead to misclassification. The term 'challenge' in the context of a geographical reference should prompt a closer examination of whether it relates to sports or a broader social issue.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clarify Guidelines on Economic and Geopolitical Overlap**: Develop clearer guidelines that specify when to prioritize geopolitical implications over economic discussions, especially in contexts involving specific countries or regions.

2. **Enhance Training on Geographical References**: Provide additional training on how to interpret geographical references in headlines, emphasizing the need to distinguish between sports-related and political contexts.

3. **Refine Reasoning Framework**: Encourage a more nuanced approach in the chain of thought that considers the potential intersections of categories, particularly between economic and technological discussions.

4. **Implement a Review Process for Ambiguous Cases**: Establish a review mechanism for headlines that fall into ambiguous categories, allowing for a second opinion or a more thorough analysis before final classification.

By addressing these key points, the classification accuracy can be significantly improved, reducing the percentage of incorrect predictions in future analyses.</div>
