            <h2>Current Prompt</h2>
            <div class="prompt">## Improved Prompt:

Your goal is to classify the following news headlines into one of the following categories:
1- World
2- Sports
3- Business
4- Sci/Tech

When classifying, adhere to the following guidelines:

- **World**: Look for geopolitical events, conflicts, or significant social issues. Be cautious of geographical references that may relate to sports. Avoid classifying headlines as 'World' if they primarily discuss competitive events or sports terminology.

- **Sports**: Identify terms related to teams, players, or specific sports terminology. If a headline includes geographical mentions but focuses on competition (e.g., "fighting chance"), classify it as 'Sports' rather than 'World'.

- **Business**: Focus on financial terminology, corporate actions, and economic indicators. If a headline discusses economic issues with geopolitical implications (e.g., oil exports), classify it as 'World' instead of 'Business'.

- **Sci/Tech**: Look for terms related to technology, scientific exploration, or digital advancements. If economic discussions are framed in a technological context, classify them as 'Sci/Tech' rather than 'Business'.

Provide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:
{
    "chain_of_thought": "Your step-by-step reasoning here, breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term. Ensure your reasoning avoids overgeneralization and aligns closely with the specific context of the headline.",
    "topic": "The identified topic - the ONLY possible topics are 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Sci/Tech'. Output just one single category."

The terms 'debt' and 'home prices' are associated with economic discussions and financial stability.

                <h3>Correct Predictions Analysis</h3>
                <div class="analysis">### Analysis of Correct Predictions in Multiclass Classification

1. **Common Patterns in Reasoning**:
   - Successful classifications often stem from a clear identification of key terms and phrases that signal the context of the headline. For instance, terms like "explorers," "ancient city," and "scientific exploration" consistently lead to the Sci/Tech category, while "job relocation" and "corporate actions" are strong indicators for Business. This pattern highlights the importance of contextual keywords in guiding classification.

2. **Key Features Mapping to Categories**:
   - Each category has distinct linguistic markers:
     - **World**: Geopolitical terms (e.g., "troops," "settlement," "bombing") and references to significant social issues.
     - **Sports**: Names of teams, players, and sports terminology (e.g., "rally," "batsmen," "practice crash").
     - **Business**: Financial terminology, corporate actions, and economic indicators (e.g., "pay cut," "revenue surge").
     - **Sci/Tech**: References to technology, scientific advancements, and digital innovations (e.g., "supercomputer," "internet cafes").
   - Recognizing these features helps in accurately categorizing headlines.

3. **Clear Category Boundaries**:
   - The analysis reveals that while some terms may overlap (e.g., economic discussions in Sci/Tech), the context in which they are used is crucial. For example, discussions about technology's impact on business should be classified as Sci/Tech, while corporate financial decisions should be categorized as Business. This distinction emphasizes the need for careful contextual interpretation to avoid misclassification.

4. **Effective Reasoning Strategies**:
   - Successful reasoning often involves breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term. This method allows classifiers to avoid overgeneralization and ensures that the reasoning aligns closely with the specific context of the headline. For instance, recognizing that "Gay Marriage Issue" pertains to social and political contexts rather than sports or business is a critical reasoning strategy.

5. **Reinforcement Suggestions**:
   - To reinforce successful patterns, training could focus on enhancing the recognition of key terms and their contextual implications through examples and counterexamples. Additionally, developing a more robust framework for distinguishing between overlapping categories could further improve classification accuracy. Regularly updating the training data with recent headlines can also help maintain relevance in classification.

By focusing on these key points, classifiers can enhance their accuracy and consistency in multiclass classification tasks.</div>
                
                
                
                <h3>Incorrect Predictions Analysis</h3>
                <div class="analysis">### Analysis of Incorrect Predictions

1. **Common Patterns in Misclassifications**:
   - **Geographical References**: Several misclassifications stem from the presence of geographical terms (e.g., "Iraq," "Arizona") that led to confusion between 'World' and 'Sports' categories. For instance, "Ali gives Iraq fighting chance" was misclassified as 'World' instead of 'Sports' due to the geographical mention overshadowing the competitive context implied by "fighting chance."
   - **Economic vs. Geopolitical Context**: The distinction between economic discussions and geopolitical events is often blurred. For example, "Iraqi oil exports slump: report" was misclassified as 'Business' instead of 'World' because the economic implications of oil exports were interpreted without considering the geopolitical significance of Iraq's oil industry.

2. **Ambiguous Elements Leading to Incorrect Classifications**:
   - **Vague Terminology**: Terms like "challenge" in "Melvin Faces Major Challenge in Arizona" lack specificity, making it difficult to ascertain whether the context is political, social, or sports-related. This ambiguity can lead to misclassification, as seen when it was categorized as 'World' instead of 'Sports'.
   - **Generalized Phrasing**: Headlines like "World briefs" can be interpreted in multiple ways. The term "World" suggests international news, but without specific indicators, it was misclassified as 'Business'. This highlights the need for clearer context in ambiguous phrases.

3. **Chain of Thought Errors**:
   - **Overgeneralization**: In several cases, the reasoning process involved overgeneralizing the implications of terms. For instance, the chain of thought for "Greenspan: Debt, home prices not dangerous" focused too heavily on economic terminology without adequately considering the broader implications of these terms in a technological context, leading to a misclassification of 'Business' instead of 'Sci/Tech'.
   - **Misinterpretation of Context**: The reasoning for "Ali gives Iraq fighting chance" misinterpreted the competitive nature of the phrase, leaning towards a geopolitical interpretation rather than recognizing it as a sports context. This misinterpretation reflects a failure to adequately assess the implications of the terms used.

4. **Potential Category Boundary Confusion Points**:
   - **Overlap Between Business and World**: The distinction between 'Business' and 'World' can be particularly challenging, especially when economic issues have geopolitical implications. The misclassification of "Iraqi oil exports slump: report" as 'Business' instead of 'World' illustrates this confusion, as the economic aspect is deeply intertwined with global politics.
   - **Sports and World Intersections**: The overlap between 'Sports' and 'World' categories can lead to confusion, especially when headlines reference countries or regions. The misclassification of "Melvin Faces Major Challenge in Arizona" as 'World' instead of 'Sports' highlights the need for clearer guidelines on how to interpret competitive language in a geopolitical context.

### Recommendations for Improvement
- **Enhance Contextual Clarity**: Provide clearer definitions and examples for ambiguous terms that could belong to multiple categories. This will help classifiers better understand the context and implications of the language used.
- **Refine Guidelines for Geographical References**: Develop specific guidelines on how to handle geographical mentions, particularly in relation to sports and world events, to reduce misclassification.
- **Encourage Specificity in Reasoning**: Train classifiers to avoid overgeneralization and to focus on the specific context of terms used in headlines. This could involve emphasizing the importance of understanding the nuances of language in different contexts.
- **Implement Cross-Category Training**: Provide training that emphasizes the intersections between categories, particularly between 'Business' and 'World', as well as 'Sports' and 'World', to help classifiers recognize when a headline may straddle multiple categories.</div>
