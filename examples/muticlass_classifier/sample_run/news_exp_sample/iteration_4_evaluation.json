  "prompt": "## Improved Prompt:\n\nYour goal is to classify the following news headlines into one of the following categories:\n1- World\n2- Sports\n3- Business\n4- Sci/Tech\n\nWhen classifying, adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n- **World**: Look for geopolitical events, conflicts, or significant social issues. Avoid classifying headlines as 'World' if they primarily discuss competitive events or sports terminology. Be cautious of geographical references that may relate to sports.\n\n- **Sports**: Identify terms related to teams, players, or specific sports terminology. If a headline includes geographical mentions but focuses on competition (e.g., \"fighting chance\"), classify it as 'Sports' rather than 'World'. Do not classify headlines as 'Sports' if they discuss economic or technological implications.\n\n- **Business**: Focus on financial terminology, corporate actions, and economic indicators. If a headline discusses economic issues with geopolitical implications (e.g., oil exports), classify it as 'World' instead of 'Business'. Avoid classifying headlines as 'Business' if they primarily discuss technological advancements.\n\n- **Sci/Tech**: Look for terms related to technology, scientific exploration, or digital advancements. If economic discussions are framed in a technological context, classify them as 'Sci/Tech' rather than 'Business'. Do not classify headlines as 'Sci/Tech' if they focus solely on geopolitical or competitive aspects.\n\nProvide your response as a JSON dictionary with the following structure:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Your step-by-step reasoning here, breaking down the headline into its components and assessing the implications of each term. Ensure your reasoning avoids overgeneralization and aligns closely with the specific context of the headline.\",\n    \"topic\": \"The identified topic - the ONLY possible topics are 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Sci/Tech'.
